Hmm . . . as I think about it, although I eagerly await this fix, I
believe we are looking at two separate issues.  We are still running
3.0.1 series on our production servers and clients because of this issue
(and some others).  However, I personally run the latest client from
heuler.  I have the problem on both the latest x2goserver and the old
3.0.1-5 x2goserver.  It appears to be a client and not a server issue
and appeared with the move to libssh.

The delay is not inconsequential.  We are not talking about a sese of
sluggishness with a 250ms delay.  We are talking about a 2 to 5 full
second delay for the final keystrokes or screens to appear.  Everything
else until the final bit is lightning fast even on WAN links - John
