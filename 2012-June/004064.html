<PRE>Hi.
At first, thank you for extremely quick answer.

If this issue is known, then it may be good to add 'Conflicts:
libcairo (&gt;= 1.12)' to debian/control file of main version of
x2goagent. It could save some hair of new users from becoming gray.

I've tried both of your pieces of advice.
On 32bit server i've downgraded libcairo to 1.8 (it would be better to
have 1.10 but it's available in repo no more) and also had to
downgrade everything that depends on it.
After that both nxserver and x2goserver work good. If i have time i'll
also try newer nxserver (i really enjoy their lightweight Win32
client), although i've heard that freenx lacks support and tends to
become abandoned.

On 64bit server i've updated x2go server apps to wheezy/heuler
versions and it also works now. lxterminal and chromium seems to be
slow (although, chromium via `ssh -X' never worked fast; lxterminal
scrolls slowly but it's not dramatically slow) and icedove doesn't
seem to be slow at all.

Although, issue about problems with resuming is actual: both
lxterminal and icedove lose all text labels and cannot show any text
(see attached screenshot of menu ) until i close them and open again
(minimize + restore or resize doesn't help).

One more thing, about exporting client dirs to x2go session: it works
only when i set (in x2goclient session settings) local encoding to
windows-1251, but my OS and FS supports and uses unicode, does anybody
work on fixing such support in x2goclient?
Also even when I set local encoding to cp1251, on server side I see
that dots from the beginning of filenames (yes, I have folders with
names like .ssh, files .bashrc, etc) are stripped. That doesn't seem
to be correct behavior.

Thanks again for your answer, also I hope that I can help in improving
x2go project too.
