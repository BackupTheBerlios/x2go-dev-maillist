</I>I don't spend much time on windows (although I need to as many of our
clients will be running X2Go on Windows) but I have noticed an anomaly
even in Linux.  If I copy/cut from the physical to the virtual desktop,
it works fine all the time.  However, if I c/c from the virtual desktop,
the clipboard is transferred to the physical Linux desktop but is not
&quot;active&quot; for some reason.

For example, I usually run KDE.  If I look in Klipper, I see the
clipboard entry but it is not selected.  If I select it and then paste,
it works as expected.  In Windows, since there's not an out-of-the-box
equivalent to Klipper (as far as I know), one cannot retrieve the
contents that are probably available somehow in the clipboard.

I have not worked on this extensively yet.  Anecdotally, it seems that
if I leave the c/c text highlighted in my virtual desktop, it does seem
active in my physical desktop but I've not validated the consistency of
that observation.

I'd love to know the underlying cause and how we fix it.  I assume the
root cause is the same in Windows and Linux.  It's almost as if the
current clipboard item is replaced by a null or empty string in the
process of returning back to the physical desktop - John
