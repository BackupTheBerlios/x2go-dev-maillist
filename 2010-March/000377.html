<PRE>Hello, all.  I've been observing a serious issue with enough consistency
that I'll report it.  On highly congested links, we are noticing that
keystrokes are delivered out of order.

I do not know the internals of NX or even what its underlying transport
is.  It almost appears as if every keystroke is a packet as it is with
telnet and the packets are being processed in their out of order
sequence. I would think that SSH over TCP would handle packet ordering
problems.  When severely congested, the typing speed on the remote
desktop becomes very lagged but, if one types far enough ahead, the far
end of the buffer is played out of order particularly when there are the
same characters close to each other (perhaps a compression bug? we have
not done enough observation on that to state it dogmatically).

For example, I don't know how many times today I typed something like
&quot;shared database in a complete&quot; and had it come out &quot;sharedd ataabse
ina compleet&quot; (in case that is displayed across a line break, there are
two spaces between ataabse and ina).

This can be exasperating to our clients when links are congested.  It's
one thing to have to wait for the display while it's another to see the
display display something other than what was typed :-) Thanks - John
