</I>We did not use it.  All of our desktops are running on a limited number
of very large VServer hosts - so we use virtual machine per virtual
desktop.  Since it is a shared memory environment, we were concerned
about inflating memory use.  We were not as concerned about performance
because most of the traffic is literally inside the VServer host and
does not even hit the Gb ethernet connections.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why don't you use xtightvncviewer or ssvnc? (x11vnc likes the tightvnc
</I>&gt;<i> protocol).
</I>We did not use ssvnc because we did not see it in the Lenny repository
or in lenny-backports.  It also has a very ugly interface even though
very powerful.  On the other hand, the xtightvncviewer interface was too
minimal.  xvnc4viewer was a nice balance for our environment - it looked
good and gave ready access to options.  We also did not have to
specify :0 on the target - intuitive for techs but not for end users.
Simply entering the target name without the display means fewer help
desk calls.
&lt;snip&gt;
The biggest challenge for us was getting the right combination of the
truly overwhelming x11vnc options.  The combination we eventually
settled on is:

x11vnc -display :50 -shared -accept &quot;popup&quot; -gone &quot;popup&quot; -noxdamage
-gui start,simple,tray=setpass

There are some caveats here.  Because the traffic is in an isolated data
center with no users on the local network and because the traffic does
not even tough the network in most cases, we did not implement ssl and
we did not tunnel it through ssh to avoid the overhead.  We also found
xvnc4viewer did not support ssl (although we did not try very hard since
we did not need it).  We did want the users to set a password every time
they started it.  The noxdamage apparently compensates for a bug and
provides much better performance when disabled.

The one thing I would like to change is that the user must click on
enable remote connections in the password dialog.  I would like to
default it to that.  We tried the unlock and nodeny options but seem to
confuse the command line parser.

So far, we have been very pleased with the results but we just
implemented it a couple of days ago.  Hope this helps - John
