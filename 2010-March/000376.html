Oops! We've hit some nastier issues.  Using an X2Go Client on a
different station this morning, I encountered the empty dialog.  I
cleared the offending entry from known_hosts and tried again.  This time
I was told I needed to answer yes or no.  Clicking Yes had no effect.
Clicking no caused the entire x2goclient to crash and disappear - I
assume a seg fault.

I had a sneaking suspicion of what was happening.  Connecting from a
console gave me this:
Warning: the RSA host key for '[vdhost01.ssiservices.biz]:443' differs
from the key for the IP address '[208.46.93.8]:443'
Offending key for IP in /home/jsullivan/.ssh/known_hosts:3
Matching host key in /home/jsullivan/.ssh/known_hosts:24
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

I cleared the offending IP address entry and all worked well but we do
have this seg fault to address - John
