As I said, with my very poor internet-connection it is much better then VNC to 
log into work. But on lan it feels slower. I did measure it with some X-tests 
and the results where the same for local, xdmcp and x2go.

When users &quot;feel&quot; that something is slow, its not always the throughput. Your 
explaination actually makes much more sense. It probably is the latency. That 
would also explain why it doesn't improve when I change compression levels.

&gt;<i> It still really feels like Nagle is enabled.  I've not 100%

</I>
So what to do with that? Is there a way to disable ssh for local lan 
connections?

Have fun,

Arnold
