That are exactly the kind of answers I was looking for.

I don't have a Windows computer to test or reproduce it. My customer
lives 300 km away and I have not much contact with him, and he don't
cares much about this problem. I was just curious about it.

&gt;<i> Please remember, most of us are volunteers answering questions in their
</I>&gt;<i> spare time.  You have a customer, you're making money from this and
</I>&gt;<i> we're supposed to work for you for free?  
</I>
You can do that, or you can not do that, you're choice.

&gt;<i> Then you should at least have
</I>&gt;<i> the common courtesy to provide us with the necessary details to answer
</I>&gt;<i> your question.  If you don't want to do that, shell out the money and
</I>&gt;<i> pay for support - there are people on the list that offer paid support,
</I>&gt;<i> after all.
</I>
I offer paid support myself, but I am a Linux man and not a Windows man.
Sometimes you ask something at colleagues. It was not a bug report.

With regards,
Paul.
