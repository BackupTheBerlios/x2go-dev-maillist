I cannot confirm that it is slower than VNC on a LAN but I can confirm
that I have seen a dramatic increase in latency since the move to
libssh.  It still really feels like Nagle is enabled.  I've not 100%
ruled out that it is not something in my environment like packet loss on
our connections but it doesn't feel like it.  It feels exactly like
packet coalescing as it is just the last bit of input that is badly
delay - badly as in a second or so so  very noticeable with serious
production impact as it leads to dangerous mistakes while editing
documents.  I wonder if libssh does not have the ability to disable it.

As a side note, I'm also really missing the setting of the ToS bits
since moving to libssh.  We currently have no way to distinguish X2Go
interactive traffic (key strokes and screens) from bulk traffic (file
transfers and print jobs).

Thanks - John
