<PRE>Hi all,

I am having some doubts about the future of X2Go and seeking for answers.
I saw mails mentioning nx3.6 which seems a bit strange to me given that the 
next version of nomachine's nx is 4.0. And that is what makes me wonder about 
the future of x2go: The main parts of x2go (nx-agent and assorted low-level 
libraries) seem to go closed-source, at least as far as I can tell from their 
licensing documents. So what happens to X2Go?

I love the work you guys did and do. Resuming sessions while changing desktop-
geometry is real fun. Having responsive desktops over WAN where vnc just 
doesn't work, is real fun. Using locally attached usb-stick on the remote 
server is real fun. Which made me &quot;force&quot; my colleages switch from our old 
VNC-based setup to X2Go. Sadly the expirience suffered when we updated the nx-
libs from 3.4 to 3.5: On WAN-connections its still usable but on LAN X2Go 
looses in speed and latency and responsiveness against VNC. Which my co-
workers really hate.
My hope was that next nx-libs might fix this. And they probably will, but not 
for us when there is a price-tag associated with it.
So how to go on in our case? What is your future planning for X2Go? Do you 
have plans (and knowledge and manpower) to further develop the nx-libs on the 
open-source base? Do you have a promise from nomachine that the libs will go 
open-source again? Do you have plans to use a different x-protocol like vnc 
from tigervnc or turbovnc? (Combining the speed of tigervnc and the features 
of sessions and apps and storage-forwarding of x2go seems like a good idea to 
me currently.)

Thanks for your answers!

Have a nice weekend,

Arnold
