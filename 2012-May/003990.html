Simply adding an import option will cause issues when users want to 
change the password - they will have to do it once in PuTTYgen for their 
PPK file, and once in X2Go client (or re-import the key).

I'd prefer it if X2Go client would be able to read such key files 
natively, without having to call PuTTYgen each time, or forcing an 
export/import action.

&gt;<i> IMO this is not a good idea. It adds functionality that is out of scope

</I>
Assuming that a ssh-agent is available in cygwin, calling that in the 
background (so it doesn't show up as an extra icon) wouldn't introduce 
that much new code into the client.

&gt;&gt;<i> [..] or run pageant.exe, PuTTY's ssh agent.
</I>
&gt;<i> This is probably the best solution as it provides a clean separation of
</I>&gt;<i> concerns.
</I>
It's the safest from a security standpoint, but it's the worst from a 
usability standpoint, as it requires configuration in two different 
locations (a batch file loading pageant and the proper key, and the X2Go 
client configuration) and also needs two icons in the notification area 
- if a user terminates pageant.exe, X2Go Client will fail to work. 
Explaining why that is the case to a non-technical user will prompt a 
&quot;Why isn't it all integrated into one application?  That's stupid! 
Duh!&quot; kind of response.
