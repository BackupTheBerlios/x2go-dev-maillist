No can do. I can test against a Debian Squeeze server with X2Go's stable 
packages, though.

[...]

&gt;<i> I do have some other issues, though. Especially when starting a flash video in
</I>&gt;<i> Iceweasel, sound is choppy, distorted, (&lt;  buffer underruns?) the video will halt
</I>&gt;<i> a few seconds in-play, sound will roll on for like 20 seconds, then stop, video
</I>&gt;<i> catch up fast and once the video has reached the sound position, both video and
</I>&gt;<i> sound playback will pick up again, but sound and picture will be desynchronized
</I>&gt;<i> as the sound makes a 20 seconds jump into the &quot;future&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a very odd behavior, but I'm not sure what to make of it.
</I>
Our old friend Nagle?

&gt;<i> I have noticed problems when running pavucontrol and mplayer both at the same
</I>&gt;<i> time, though.
</I>
What kind of problems?

&gt;<i> But I figure both the pavucontrol+mplayer and flash video problems are due to
</I>&gt;<i> the remote ADSL connection. I see a peak incoming traffic of about 250KB/s,
</I>&gt;<i> hardly enough for both sound and video. Another circumstance that may well
</I>&gt;<i> confirm this theory is that lowering the image quality (i.e., set to JPEG
</I>&gt;<i> compression with 64 colors) has a positive effect on the sound output.
</I>
Do we have some sort of rough estimate how much bandwidth we need for 
which color depth?

And would it be possible to lower the sound quality to conserve some 
bandwidth? I mean, it's rather unlikely somebody is going to expect 
Dolby 5.1 sound quality via GSM... ;-)

&gt;<i> I'd really be interested to see tests on LAN, but unfortunately my only other
</I>&gt;<i> box has no PA installed and I don't want to pollute the system with it. However,
</I>&gt;<i> I guess that Stefan could come in here handy.
</I>
I'll give it a try, but I'm not really a Mac user (I bought this Mac 
solely to support X2Go development for Mac), so Jan and Stephan should 
join in if you want reliable results.

&gt;<i> The code is not yet ready and I still have to tackle the esound emulation stuff,
</I>&gt;<i> but I'd be happy to dump a test build here. Is anyone interested? Let me know.
</I>
Jan, Stephan, your call!
