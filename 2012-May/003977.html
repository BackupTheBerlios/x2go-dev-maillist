</I>&gt;<i> I did a new install with &quot;apt-get install x2goserver&quot;. So the latest
</I>&gt;<i> version. And x2gognomebindings.
</I>
And the repository you used was stable or heuler?

&gt;&gt;<i> - list of packages and version numbers of the desktop environment
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are asking a lot...
</I>
Because there is a lot that can go wrong.

&gt;&gt;<i> - version number of Windows client
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The latest X2goclient version.
</I>
Again, the latest *stable* client, or one of the release candidates?

&gt;&gt;<i> - the exact error message your customer is seeing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    (preferably including a detailed log from the login process)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have that. My customer just said that it did not work
</I>&gt;<i> full-screen, and that there was no need to get it working.
</I>&gt;<i> But I am curious.
</I>
And again, you're witholding vital information.
&quot;does not work&quot; is a state, but not a bug report.
There are a multitude of ways that the x2goclient can be used, how 
exactly should we be able to tell which one your customer is using if 
you don't tell us?  Just as a quick reminder, there's single application 
mode, published application mode, and the option to display a virtual 
desktop that doesn't fill the entire screen, as well as the full screen 
option, and and and... plus, the way you worded your original message it 
sounded like &quot;I have a client where x2goclient isn't working at all, and 
I need fullscreen mode there.&quot;

&gt;&gt;<i> Obviously, it is impossible to start a $FOO session if the $FOO Desktop
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Environment hasn't been installed on the server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was just meaned as a very simple question, something like: &quot;does it
</I>&gt;<i> work for you?&quot; of &quot;is it known not to work?&quot;.
</I>
And the answer is rather complex, as it depends a lot on your setup, 
unless &quot;Works for me&quot; and &quot;I can imagine a few scenarios where it might 
not work&quot; are the answers you were looking for, which I doubt.

Please remember, most of us are volunteers answering questions in their 
spare time.  You have a customer, you're making money from this and 
we're supposed to work for you for free?  Then you should at least have 
the common courtesy to provide us with the necessary details to answer 
your question.  If you don't want to do that, shell out the money and 
pay for support - there are people on the list that offer paid support, 
after all.

-Stefan
PS: I'm not going to waste my time answering you any further in this 
thread, maybe others will pick up if you provide sufficient information.
