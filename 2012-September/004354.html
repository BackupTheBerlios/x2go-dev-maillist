Yes, this is needed.

Why not??? This is also needed as the X2Go session DB stores  
hostnames, not IPs.

</I>
It is another source of the problem. And it is not a firewall issue.  
Put your hostnames in /etc/hosts of the machines if you cannot set up  
DNS as needed for X2Go.

&gt;<i> Are guessing this is an ssh issue and are working to sort that.  We

</I>&gt;<i> guests and hosts, but figure we want to get the printing working  
</I>&gt;<i> first and then think about possible security issues.
</I>
You can heavily restrict ssh daemon access in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.  
Feel free to narrow SSH access down as much as needed.

&gt;<i> SO...when we first try to connect via ssh commands from the cups

</I>
Then your private/public key pair is not working properly.

&gt;<i> We couldn't get the initial &quot;here's how you move the public key from

</I>&gt;<i> /home/x2goprint/.ssh and added the public key info to  
</I>&gt;<i> authorized_keys there by hand....this also may be the source of the  
</I>&gt;<i> problem.  We've tried checking the permissions and ownership on  
</I>&gt;<i> /home/x2goprint and it's .ssh and authorized_keys, as well as the  
</I>&gt;<i> x2go servers sshd_config file but no joy yet.  Interestingly, our  
</I>&gt;<i> attempts do create a know_hosts file so we think some level of  
</I>&gt;<i> connection occurs.
</I>
What does ,,getent passwd x2goprint'' tell you about x2goprint's home  
directory. I have no idea why you cling to /home/x2goprint. This is  
_not_ (!!!) the home of the x2goprint user as created on a default  
X2Go server installation.

&gt;<i> What's interesting, is that the print jobs show up in the  
</I>&gt;<i> /var/spool/cups logs on the cups server (Vserver host), so there
</I>
No, that is not interesting at all. (Sorry for my sarcasm). This is  
where CUPS (not cups-x2go) puts the spool job files. The fact, that  
the files appear in /var/spool/cups simply means that your CUPS  
installation is working. It does not say anythin about X2Go  
functioning or not.

&gt;<i> seems to be some level of connection....sowe're guessing the the  
</I>&gt;<i> correct ssh connection is &quot;the problem&quot; we need to fix for x2goprint  
</I>&gt;<i> (the script) to work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the input - may write back with questions, or hopefully  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;this is how we solved this&quot;...

&gt;<i> Best,
