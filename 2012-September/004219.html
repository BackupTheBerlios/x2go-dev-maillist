<PRE>Hi list,

I would suggest moving the bug reports to a new mailing list, if that is 
technically possible, say, one named x2go-bugs.
That way, x2go-dev would be available for discussions regarding further 
development, &quot;is-this-a-bug-or-am-I-doing-it-wrong&quot;, feature 
enhancements etc. and x2go-bugs would be for the bug-tracking grunt work.

General ideas:
- Every coder should subscribe to x2go-bugs as well.
- Feature requests that have been agreed upon on x2go-dev should be CCed 
to x2go-bugs *by the coder willing to pick up the task* to avoid dupes.
- Using two different lists will make it easier for list-newbies on 
x2go-dev that may not yet know how to properly set up a filter rule 
(central vs. individual administration).
- Cross-posting bug reports from the bug-hunting mailing list to 
x2go-dev will be allowed/tolerated for a limited amount of time until we 
can be sure all the relevant developers are subscribed to x2go-bugs (or 
whatever name we'll end up with).
- The automatic signature on x2go-dev should be amended with &quot;before 
posting a bug, please check &lt;web page of bugtracker or web page of 
x2go-bugs ML archive&gt; if your problem is already known.&quot;.
- Should an inexperienced list member post a new bug on x2go-dev, one of 
the more experienced list members (preferably one of the devs) should 
pick it up and reply with a message like &quot;added to tracker, id is &lt;foo&gt;, 
see &lt;link to Tracker/ML archive)&gt;, thanks for reporting the issue.&quot;
- A similar approach would be in order for already known bugs, WONTFIXes 
etc.

Comments, anyone?

-Stefan
