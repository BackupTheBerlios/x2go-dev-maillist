<PRE>Hi list,

I'm currently experimenting with x2goclient 3.99.2.2 on Mac OS X and 
this is what I've found &quot;weird/fix-worthy&quot; so far:

1) PulseAudio stutters (just like it does in the current MS-Windows client)
2) when x2goclient is called with &quot;--hide&quot;, there is no way to access 
the &quot;Published Applications&quot; menu
2.1) there is no way to start published applications from the dock 
(compare right-click on systray icon on MS-Windows)
2.2) there also is no way to start published applications from the 
x2goclient menu on the upper screen border

Re: 1) I'm not sure what we can do about this; it seems Mihai's attempts 
to make the PulseAudio developers aware of the issues have failed. :-(

The other issues look like they could be fixed by the x2go-devs, though, 
so I'm posting my suggestions here:

Re: 2) &quot;--hide&quot;, on Windows (and probably also on Linux, though I never 
checked it there), means &quot;hide-to-systray&quot;, so parts of the application 
remain accessible via right-click (context menu).
I guess a sensible action on Mac OS, when &quot;--hide&quot; is used, would be to 
do a &quot;minimize&quot; by going straight to the Dock on startup, but, upon 
clicking the Dock icon, show the usual screen (just like after 
un-minimizing any other app).
This is under the assumption that &quot;2.1)&quot; simply doesn't work on Mac OS.
An alternative would be to remain &quot;hidden&quot;, i.e. without a visible 
window on screen, and offering a pull-down menu with all published 
applications on the top menu bar (&quot;2.2)&quot;).

Now, before anyone starts coding away on this, I'd like to see some 
feedback from the Mac users here:
a) Where do you expect to find a list of published applications?
b) Is there a UI styleguide by Apple that says this must/must 
not/should/should not be done in a particular way?

-Stefan
