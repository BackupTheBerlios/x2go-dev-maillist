I very much agree with Alex here.  Although we can absolve ourselves of
the responsibility, it is wiser to do as much as we can to prevent both
admins and users from shooting themselves the stupid things they may do.
For example, it is not just a matter of a sloppy admin not realizing
they should use a separate authentication domain for the proxy; even if
they do, we have the social engineering problem of users using the same
password for the proxy as for anything else.  Once one intercepts that
password, a cracker will try it everywhere they can for that user.
Thus, I would strongly advocate all authentication even to the proxy be
protected by encryption.  Thanks - John
