Hi All:


Making progress on printing using x2go on Vserver (with x2go server on one Vserver guest using postgresql backend and cups on another with ssh connection to x2go server).  


Thanks for help (as always) Mike - 


1)  Addressed DNS issues (was in instructions - Mike, apologies)
2)  Not sure, but could not get &quot;ssh-copy-id /root.ssh/id_dsa-x2goprint <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">x2goprint at x2goserver1.your.domain</A>&quot; to work but if...
-added key with ssh-agent on cups server 
-made adjustments to sshd_config on x2go server.
-used &quot;ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/id_dsa-x2goprint <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">x2goprint at x2goserver1.your.domain</A>&quot; (with -i and think there was missing &quot;/&quot; between /root and .ssh in web instructions)
 ...we can connect.   An ls -la  shows we are in /var/spool/x2goprint of the x2go server.  Hope this approach has not fooled us into thinking the ssh connection is right.
3)  We set up the virtual x2go printer on the cups server.
4)  Checking error_log on cups server, we now have no errors and having turned on debug logging it appears that the x2go virtual printer loads correctly.
5) FYI -  &quot;getent passwd x2goprint&quot; on x2go server returns &quot;x2goprint:x:108:112::/var/spool/x2goprint:/bin/sh&quot;


We can't, however, see the virtual x2go printer from the client connection to the x2go server when we try to print.  May not matter, but if we loosen up settings in cupsd.conf on the cups server, we can connect from the x2go server via a browser and then can see the x2go printer (e.g., <A HREF="http://192.168.1.xx:631">http://192.168.1.xx:631</A>) and launch print jobs (i.e., by-passing x2goprint).


Q:  we do not have cups installed on the x2go server - is that a mistake?  Should the virutal x2go printer live on the x2go server, not the cups server?  It wouldn't seem so...


So we think we're still missing something between x2goprint and cups.


Also, the &quot;spool&quot; link in the session is broken in .x2go in the user's home folder- does this matter?  In the syslog of the x2go server we get:


Sep 29 11:39:40 vserver1 /usr/bin/x2goruncommand: launching session with Xsession-x2go mechanism, using STARTUP=&quot;/usr/bin/gnome-session&quot;
Sep 29 11:39:41 vserver1 /usr/bin/x2gomountdirs[9409]: WARNING: mounting of /home/user1/.x2go/S-user1-50-1348918777_stDGNOME_dp24/spool failed.


This error does not happen when we connect to a &quot;regular&quot; (non vserver guest) x2go server and print and the spool link is healthy&quot;.  


Q:  Does this matter?  FYI - we were getting the same sort of error when we tried printing with cups and x2go server on the same Vserver guest (single node).  


Vserver uses a &quot;fstab&quot; that sits outside of the &quot;guest&quot; environment that makes /tmp in the Vserver tmpf format and sets the size of /tmp, and the /etc/fstab inside the Vserver guest is blank.  Would this cause the broken spool link?


Q:  Our understanding is Vserver has some issues with &quot;fuse&quot;  - is that something to look at?


Think/hope  wer're getting close...thanks ,


Ted
