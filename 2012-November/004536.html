<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Now could you even tell me approximatly in which files I would have to look?
</I>
&gt;<i> /usr/lib/x2go/* They are less then 2000 lines of code!
</I>
Oh, I thought, you would rather point me to the respective source files
which (most probably) lives in x2goserver.git.

If I want to provide a patch for upstream, I should probably look there.

Since the install procedure might put quite a lot of (even unrelated)
things into /usr/lib/ , may I ask whether there is (apart from the
debian binary installation procedure) some script or Makefile that is
responsible for putting everything in place?

In fact, I'd like to know what the usual way to *compile* and to
*install* x2goserver (or anything that I would need for userspace
installation) actually is. I'd like to start compiling and installing
x2goserver from the git repository sources as foouser in his $HOME. So
as a first step I'd like to disregard all debian specific installation
parts.

Am I right that x2goserver uses the standard

  cd x2goserver; ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install

? The INSTALL file in that directory doesn't say something about
&quot;configure&quot;, but that's probably because it refers to the enduser that
extracts x2goserver from a tar.gz file and not from the git repository.

Anyway, I'll probably have to introduce a configure file to later allow
&quot;--prefix=/installation/directory&quot; as argument. Can upstream live with
that our should it rather be avoided?

Regards
Ralf
