<PRE>Thank you, Morty.

&gt;<i> As x2go supports multi server installations, too, there is a central
</I>&gt;<i>  database managing the sessions.
</I>
OK. But that's, of course, irrelevant for my use case.

&gt;<i> For single-host installations this is done using a sqlite database 
</I>&gt;<i> owned by x2gouser. It is accessed using the sbit-mechanism.
</I>
Thanks. In other words. Assume, I want to do a rootless installation as
user foouser. Then I would probably have to rewrite the sources so that
foouser is also responsible for this sqlite database (of course only for
sessions of foouser, i.e. this DB then lives somewhere under $HOME/.x2go).

&gt;&gt;<i> Are there any real needs for a root user in x2go's server setup or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does this just happen by convenience for the developers?
</I>
&gt;<i> No, there is none.
</I>
OK, there is hope. ;-)

&gt;<i> This is only due to the convenience having the same interface for
</I>&gt;<i> multi-server as well as local installations.
</I>
I don't understand what exactly you mean by multi-server and local
installation. But maybe it's irrelevant for me anyway.

Now could you even tell me approximatly in which files I would have to look?

And another question. Does the x2goclient know that an x2gouser exists
on the server. Hopefully I only have to deal with the server side.

Ralf
