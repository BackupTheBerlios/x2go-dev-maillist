X2Go Component: src:x2gothinclient
Version: 1.1.0.1
Status: RELEASE
Date: Fri, 22 Nov 2013 23:51:33 +0100
Fixes: 300 301
Changes: 
 x2gothinclient (1.1.0.1) RELEASED; urgency=low
 .
   [ Mike Gabriel ]
   * New upstream version (1.1.0.1):
     - Switch to VT-7 on TC shutdown.
     - Syntax fix in x2gousbmount script.
     - Make ~x2gothinclient rw-able on TCE machines. Thanks to Peter
       Schneider for pointing at this.
     - Remove chroot bootstrap cruft when finished with creating the
       TCE chroot.
     - Deactivate serial line terminals on X2Go thinclients.
     - Install TCE dependencies via meta-package x2gothinclient-chroot.
     - Move init scripts from debian/ folder into upstream folders.
     - Provide x2gothinclient-chroot.init script that tweaks the chroot
       during thin client startup.
     - Patch /etc/init.d/checkroot-bootclean.sh during TCE creation to
       avoid failures when clean tmp files on the read-only NFS root-fs.
     - Work around Debian bug #729373 during TCE creation. Replace alsa-utils
       init script and ALSA's utils.sh (for Debian wheezy+jessie chroots).
     - Refrain from using &quot;~&lt;user&gt;&quot; when launching X2Go Client as it cannot
       handle it, yet. Use &quot;~&quot; instead (handable by X2Go Client &gt;= 4.0.1.2).
     - Tweak the /etc/os-release more comprehensively.
     - Update initramfs at the very end of the TCE creation.
     - Do not over-mount /run as tmpfs. This is already done by the Debian
       boot process.
     - Monitor mounted USB devices via ~x2gothinclient/mounts (and not via
       deprecated location /var/run).
     - Add TC_NONINTERACTIVE (commented out) to x2gothinclient_settings config
       file.
     - Add syslog support to x2gousbmount.
     - Install radeon and i915 kms/drm module into initrd image for Debian
       (&gt;= 7).
   * debian/control:
     + New bin:package x2gothinclient-chroot.
     + Make sure x2gothinclient-chroot pulls in editing tools like
       mc, vim, less via Recommends: field.
     + Depend on x2goclient (&gt;= 4.0.1.2-0~).
     + Suggest some helpful firmware packages (also from non-free) in bin:package
       x2gothinclient-chroot.
 .
   [ Arnold Krille ]
   * New upstream version (1.1.0.1):
     - Extend x2gothinclient_shell to run anything given as arguments and
       fall back to $TC_SHELL when nothing is given. (Fixes: #301).
     - Allow non-interactive execution of x2gothinclient_create. (Fixes:
       #300).
