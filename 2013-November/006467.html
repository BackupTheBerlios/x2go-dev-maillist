X2Go Component: src:x2goserver
Version: 4.0.1.7
Status: RELEASE
Date: Fri, 22 Nov 2013 21:58:27 +0100
Fixes: 276 278 285 305 310 331
Changes: 
 x2goserver (4.0.1.7) RELEASED; urgency=low
 .
   [ Orion Poplawski ]
   * New upstream version (4.0.1.7):
     - Install Xsession file as executable, make Xsession.d directory location
       configurable during build process, do not create unused Xsession.options.
       (Fixes: #278).
 .
   [ Mike Gabriel ]
   * New upstream version (4.0.1.7):
     - Fine-tune x2goserver-xsession/Makefile: if /etc/X11 has Xsession.d and/or
       Xsession.options they get symlinked into /etc/x2go. Otherwise Xsession.d
       and Xsession.options are created under /etc/x2go as empty dir/file.
       (Fixes: #278).
     - Fix automatic keyboard setup (via x2gosetkeyboard) while resuming a
       session. (Fixes: #285).
     - Provide sudoers.d/x2goserver file that allows sudoed commands under
       KDE (by pertaining the env var QT_GRAPHICSSYSTEM. (Fixes: #276).
     - With PostgreSQL as session db backend, prevent the root user from
       launching sessions. Also, prevent x2gouser_root from being added as a
       PostgreSQL user. (Fixes: #310).
     - Execute DB status changes as late as possible during suspend / terminate.
     - Start/resume rootless sessions without geometry parameter. Esp. using
       X2GO_GEOMETRY=fullscreen for rootless sessions lead to an extra 1x1 px
       session window (nxagentCreateIconWindow in nxagent's Window.c).
     - Typo fix in x2goruncommand (for MATE session startup).
   * debian/control:
     + Update LONG_DESCRIPTIONS.
     + Raise Standards: to 3.9.4 (no changes needed).
     + Move xfonts-base to Recommends: field of bin:package x2goserver.
   * debian/x2goserver.init:
     + Make init script LSB compliant.
 .
   [ Helmer Teles ]
   * New upstream version (4.0.1.7):
     - Make umask that is used when mounting client-side folders via SSHFS
       configurable in x2goserver.conf. (Fixes: #331).
 .
   [ J&#252;rgen H&#246;tzel ]
   * New upstream version (4.0.1.7):
     - Use bash-builtin 'type' instead of to be avoided 'which'. (Fixes: #305).
 .
   [ Oleksandr Shneyder ]
   * New upstream version (4.0.0.6):
     - Fix x2goruncommand: &quot;type -P $cmd&quot; can create new lines in EXEC
       variable if command have the arguments wich have same names as existing
       commands, for example &quot;rdesktop -k nl&quot; -&gt; &quot;/usr/bin/rdesktop\n/usr/bin/nl&quot;.
       Now we splitting $cmd and taking only first part.
