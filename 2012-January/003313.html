Guys,

it would be really helpful if someone could type up a step-by-step guide 
for testing.  I'd love to try this out, but either I *did* something 
wrong or something *goes* wrong, as the following had no positive effect 
whatsoever:
* add heuler repository, apt-get update
* apt-get install libjpeg-turbo62 on my squeeze-based server
* connect from latest Microsoft Windows client to said server
* use Iceweasel in rootless mode, access YouTube and watch a movie

The only effect I saw was a &quot;screen hang&quot; when leaving YouTube for 
another web site, and no speed increase whatsoever. :-(

Looking at the discussion in this thread and at the libjpeg-turbo 
documentation leaves me even more confused than before.

My questions, in particular, are:
1) Will this currently only work between Linux Clients and Linux Servers?
2) Will it work with rootless sessions? (I remember NoMachine/FreeNX 
once stated that rootless sessions in general - i.e. not related to 
libjpeg-turbo - gain less speed than a fullscreen session - but that was 
years ago and may have changed and may not apply to X2Go at all, I don't 
know.)
3) Is the library required on both the server *and* on the client?
4) Should it work &quot;out of the box&quot; after installing the package, or do I 
have to change some file somewhere to add the library path?
5) Do I have to restart a daemon after changing this file?
6) Why was I able to install the package without apt-get telling me it 
would remove the &quot;non-turbo&quot; library package? To make this clear, I 
don't complain about a lack of a warning (Mike did provide such a 
warning in his posting), but I'm surprised about the lack of *action* 
i.e. no library package has been removed when I installed the 
libjpeg-turbo62 package.

Kind Regards,
Stefan
