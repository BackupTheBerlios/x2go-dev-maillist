<PRE>Hi Marcelo,

I am not a developer myself, but we (Debian X2Go Packaging Team) have  
a developer on board that will sponsor the upload once the discussion  
returns a positive feedback.

People on debian-devel think the freenx project to be dead. It would  
be a real contribution if you could send a mail to:
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">655618 at bugs.debian.org</A>

... and say: Hi! Here is FreeNX calling! We are very interested in  
this ITP, we are alive and we have been waiting for such a thing to  
happen.

Once nxagent &amp; co are in Debian, finding a sponsor for FreeNX should  
be surely possible. The problem is NX itself (the large Xorg 6.9 fork  
within it), not the packages around NX libraries and binaries.

&gt;<i> X2Go packaging, is mostly about removing nomachine brand and adding x2go
</I>&gt;<i> brand, so I think it can be done in the build process with nx-x11 package.
</I>&gt;<i> The nx-x11 package is a dpkg source v3 with multiples tarballs.
</I>&gt;<i> Once nx-x11 is accepted is only modify the build script to build the
</I>&gt;<i> branded x2goagent.
</I>
This has changed since yesterday. Oleksandr Shneyder and I have merged  
x2goagent completely into NX with the following feature:

   o execute nxagent under the binary name ,,nxagent''
     -&gt; launch nxagent with all patches from FreeNX-Team on LP, no branding
   o execute nxagent under the binary name ,,x2goagent''
     -&gt; launch nxagent with X2Go flavor (branding)

With today's and yesterday's work we are able to drop 20mb of forked  
x2goagent code and simple use NX for X2Go directly.

If you find some time, please take a look at ,,NX (redistributed)''
<A HREF="http://code.x2go.org/gitweb?p=nx-libs.git;a=summary">http://code.x2go.org/gitweb?p=nx-libs.git;a=summary</A>

We/I would be really really glad if you are interested in joining the  
,,NX (redistributed)'' maintenance team. We (Mike, Alex, Reinhard)  
invented ,,NX (redistributed)'' to provide active usptream support and  
high reponse levels to security issues and bug fixes being sent in by  
the distro packaging teams. For Debian we are acting in a dual role as  
we are upstream and packages at the same time. For others like Fedora  
&amp; co, we may be upstream with this redistribution project.

We also should think about communication.

Currently, we use the x2go-dev mailing list for communication about  
,,NX (redistributed)''. However, there is quite some X2Go'ish-only  
noise on that list, as well. If you can live with that, it might be a  
good idea to subscribe to that list?
<A HREF="http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev</A>

The ML language is English, of course.

So, these were three requests...

   1. Send a short notice to the Debian bug I gave you above
   2. Join the NX (redistributed) team ;-)
   3. Subscribe to x2go-dev, we may later think about other forms of
      communication, i.e. a separate ML.

BTW: I posted the ITP mail to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">freenx-team at lists.launchpad.net</A>, but it  
got bounced. Is the list dead?

Last question: are you FreeNX upstream? Or FreeNX packager or Ubuntu?

Thanks for your prompt reply!!!
Mike
