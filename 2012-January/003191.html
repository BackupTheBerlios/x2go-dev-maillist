<PRE>Hi!

&gt;<i> Please test with the Ubuntu nightly builds (tomorrow! not today!).  
</I>&gt;<i> Check on launchpad.net/~x2go that packages have been built already.
</I>
it seems that the nightly builds work just fine (both neatx-server and x2go). Thanks! Do you know already, when you will have this fix in the stable repo? (because my setup is in production)

&gt;&gt;<i> nxlibs 1:3.5.0-1-2-0ubuntu1ppa8
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>-&gt; DROP!!!
</I>
they were a dependency with the downgraded nxagent. of course i dropped them, when nxagent was upgraded.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This smells like you are using old X2Go agent code. This has been
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> settled some months ago...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I pinned the x2goserver-package to 3.0.99.7 (and patched some things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> manually) because of some problems with the newer ones, so yes, i have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> old code..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The x2goserver does not cause the keyboard bug, it actually was in  
</I>&gt;<i>x2goagent, but you have the new version. Let's see if problems persist  
</I>&gt;<i>after upgrade (nightly packages, ppa:x2go/ppa, not ppa:x2go/stable).
</I>
the keyboard-bug also seems to be gone. very good! 

perhaps i could now switch to x2go entirely as the keyboard-bug was fatal for my setup and drop support for nx as i have x2go in a thinclient environment, it is more stable and has more features. 

for the x2goserver-issues i will report when i have time for this. 

Thanks!

Jochen
