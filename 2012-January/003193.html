Ok.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People on debian-devel think the freenx project to be dead. It would be a
</I>real contribution if you could send a mail to:
&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">655618 at bugs.debian.org</A>
</I>
FreeNX is not dead.
Its user base is huge, the freenx-knx list is active, but mostly to fix
installation problems.
The most important is to get nx into the repository, then it's only 1 deb
alway from a working freenx server.
Many users still compile nx by source. And once in a while I receive some
mail from Debian users asking for debs, sadly, I just ask them to use lucid
ppa.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ... and say: Hi! Here is FreeNX calling! We are very interested in this
</I>ITP, we are alive and we have been waiting for such a thing to happen.

We are waiting a long time. :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once nxagent &amp; co are in Debian, finding a sponsor for FreeNX should be
</I>surely possible. The problem is NX itself (the large Xorg 6.9 fork within
it), not the packages around NX libraries and binaries.

3 years ago I spent a lot of time trying to build nxagent with stock xorg
7.0 libraries. It compiled but didn't work.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> X2Go packaging, is mostly about removing nomachine brand and adding x2go
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> brand, so I think it can be done in the build process with nx-x11
</I>package.
&gt;&gt;<i> The nx-x11 package is a dpkg source v3 with multiples tarballs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Once nx-x11 is accepted is only modify the build script to build the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> branded x2goagent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This has changed since yesterday. Oleksandr Shneyder and I have merged
</I>x2goagent completely into NX with the following feature:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  o execute nxagent under the binary name ,,nxagent''
</I>&gt;<i>    -&gt; launch nxagent with all patches from FreeNX-Team on LP, no branding
</I>&gt;<i>  o execute nxagent under the binary name ,,x2goagent''
</I>&gt;<i>    -&gt; launch nxagent with X2Go flavor (branding)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With today's and yesterday's work we are able to drop 20mb of forked
</I>x2goagent code and simple use NX for X2Go directly.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you find some time, please take a look at ,,NX (redistributed)''
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://code.x2go.org/gitweb?p=nx-libs.git;a=summary">http://code.x2go.org/gitweb?p=nx-libs.git;a=summary</A>
</I>
Is NX redistributed a bundle with every lib?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We/I would be really really glad if you are interested in joining the
</I>,,NX (redistributed)'' maintenance team. We (Mike, Alex, Reinhard) invented
,,NX (redistributed)'' to provide active usptream support and high reponse
levels to security issues and bug fixes being sent in by the distro
packaging teams. For Debian we are acting in a dual role as we are upstream
and packages at the same time. For others like Fedora &amp; co, we may be
upstream with this redistribution project.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We also should think about communication.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, we use the x2go-dev mailing list for communication about ,,NX
</I>(redistributed)''. However, there is quite some X2Go'ish-only noise on that
list, as well. If you can live with that, it might be a good idea to
subscribe to that list?
&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The ML language is English, of course.
</I>
No problem.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, these were three requests...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  1. Send a short notice to the Debian bug I gave you above
</I>&gt;<i>  2. Join the NX (redistributed) team ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>  3. Subscribe to x2go-dev, we may later think about other forms of
</I>&gt;<i>     communication, i.e. a separate ML.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW: I posted the ITP mail to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">freenx-team at lists.launchpad.net</A>, but it got
</I>bounced. Is the list dead?

Yes, I shut down a long time ago, because there was only spams at the time.
The freenx list is <A HREF="https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/freenx-knx">https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/freenx-knx</A>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Last question: are you FreeNX upstream? Or FreeNX packager or Ubuntu?
</I>
There is no official FreeNX upstream, for some time I did some work in
launchpad, then another guy forked my branch and is still working on it.
Now I use his branch as upstream.

Regards.
Marcelo
