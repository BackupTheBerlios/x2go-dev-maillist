<PRE>Hello John,

&gt;<i> &gt; Your proposed patches in this thread seem rather cosmetic to me,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because the functionality that you require can be achieved without any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; patching as well. I'm not saying they are bad or wrong, I'd rather
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prefer the makefile to be fixed properly instead of making it more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complicated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is anyone working on fixing the makefiles in nx-libs (redistributed)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The fixes I made to the nx-libs build system were certainly more than
</I>&gt;<i> cosmetic, and they work (I've been using them for a month now), but
</I>&gt;<i> nx-libs is still being distributed with a horribly broken imake build
</I>&gt;<i> system. I certainly don't claim the fixes I made are perfect, but they
</I>&gt;<i> do work, and they do install files in their proper places, and that is
</I>&gt;<i> better than what is currently being distributed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hence, my question. Is someone working on fixing the nx-libs build files?
</I>
we are currently in the process of making this job, yes. We have substantially made a lot of work for RPMS and general build environments to accomodate the standards in distributions other than debian/ubuntu.

Please stay tuned just for some days. I will make a larger announcement on this topic to this list as soon as we got the work done.
