Just curious, is fakeroot not available *at all* on fedora/mageia systems.

That maybe right, but if we go this route, your patch is also
unnecessary, because you can also easily directly override the
INSTALL_DIR and INSTALL_FILE macros during the makefile invocation/

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The SYSCONFDIR/ETCDIR might make sense if you want to install
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> somewhere else than '$(DESTDIR)/etc/x2go'. However, I'm pretty sure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that installing those files somewhere else will break x2go in more or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> less subtle ways as I think those paths are hardcoded at more other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> places. Therefore, I wonder again what this patch fixes for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are partly right there.
</I>&gt;<i> While rediffing the patch from 3.0.99.9 I did overlook, the $(DESTDIR) was
</I>&gt;<i> already added.
</I>&gt;<i> The patch read
</I>&gt;<i> - &#160; &#160; &#160; mkdir -p /etc/X11/Xresources
</I>&gt;<i> - &#160; &#160; &#160; mkdir -p /etc/X11/Xsession.d
</I>&gt;<i> - &#160; &#160; &#160; touch /etc/X11/Xsession.options
</I>&gt;<i> + &#160; &#160; &#160; mkdir -p $(DESTDIR)$(SYSCONFDIR)/X11/Xresources
</I>&gt;<i> + &#160; &#160; &#160; mkdir -p $(DESTDIR)$(SYSCONFDIR)/X11/Xsession.d
</I>&gt;<i> in the previous version.
</I>&gt;<i> So you are right, this one isn't really needed anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> But I have to wonder, why a variable $(ETCDIR) is defined instead of
</I>&gt;<i> hardcoding it, when it will break x2goserver, if the user should define it
</I>&gt;<i> during build?
</I>&gt;<i> Your argument there seems to fire backwards.
</I>
I never claimed the Makefile to be perfect.

If we wanted the to make the location /etc/x2go/... really
configurable (which I think would be great) then this is mechanism is
a great start. Nevertheless, a lot of additional places needs to be
fixed, and I see a lot of other way more important things that need
fixing first. Therefore, I'd personally recommend to focus on things
that really need fixing first.

Your proposed patches in this thread seem rather cosmetic to me,
because the functionality that you require can be achieved without any
patching as well. I'm not saying they are bad or wrong, I'd rather
prefer the makefile to be fixed properly instead of making it more
complicated.
