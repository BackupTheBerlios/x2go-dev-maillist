Is anyone working on fixing the makefiles in nx-libs (redistributed)?

The fixes I made to the nx-libs build system were certainly more than
cosmetic, and they work (I've been using them for a month now), but
nx-libs is still being distributed with a horribly broken imake build
system. I certainly don't claim the fixes I made are perfect, but they
do work, and they do install files in their proper places, and that is
better than what is currently being distributed.

Hence, my question. Is someone working on fixing the nx-libs build files?
