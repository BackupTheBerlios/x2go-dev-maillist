<PRE>Hi Stefan

thanks - I've seen your message via the webfrontend earlier and thus
decided to sign up. However, CCing me would have been a good idea, yes.

I am flattered, but unfortunately not skilled enough to help you. The
fix I send originated from a hour-long debugging session with two other
people (non-OS X developers) - I am pretty sure I would have never
caught such a stack overflow by myself. (Actually, I tried debugging via
gdb at first and noticed the this pointer changed when going into the
newly called channelLoop function, causing the program to crash - but
was more than startled because this should have never had happened.
Turns out, the stack was full and the first parameter of the function,
i.e., &quot;this&quot; could not be pushed onto it, thus reading some random memory.)

At the same time, I am happy to say that otherwise the x2go client (from
git) is fully functioning on OS X with one little flaw - I have to test
the same git version on Linux as well to confirm a OS X specific bug though.

Oh yeah, and building nxproxy on OS X is not trivial but easily
manageable with a few build system modifications.

Best regards,


Mihai

</I>&gt;<i> Mihai, since you committed an OS X-specific patch: Would you be
</I>&gt;<i> interested in picking up development of the OS X X2Go-Client?
</I>&gt;<i> Originally, Mike wanted to take a stab at it, but didn't get around to
</I>&gt;<i> do it, and Alex won't touch the OS X port unless he gets paid for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have the necessary skills and the time to keep the OS X port
</I>&gt;<i> current, I could provide you with a Mac mini for testing.

</I>&gt;<i> for the specs&amp;  background info.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I bought this Mac specifically so someone skilled enough can work on the
</I>&gt;<i> X2Go-Client, and it's kind of sad that no one wants to pick up
</I>&gt;<i> development even though hardware is provided for free/in exchange for a
</I>&gt;<i> deposit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have enough Mac users among my clients that paying Alex (or
</I>&gt;<i> anyone else) to work on it would be economically viable...
