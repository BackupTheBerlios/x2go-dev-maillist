</I>Well, I know, that fakeroot is used in deb packaging but not in rpm 
packaging, and since you don't build as root, it's quite impossible to 
use those -g and -o options.
In addition, they are not needed at all, the package building process 
does fix the permission of these files on its own, at least rpmbuild does.

</I>You are partly right there.
While rediffing the patch from 3.0.99.9 I did overlook, the $(DESTDIR) 
was already added.
The patch read
-       mkdir -p /etc/X11/Xresources
-       mkdir -p /etc/X11/Xsession.d
-       touch /etc/X11/Xsession.options
+       mkdir -p $(DESTDIR)$(SYSCONFDIR)/X11/Xresources
+       mkdir -p $(DESTDIR)$(SYSCONFDIR)/X11/Xsession.d
in the previous version.
So you are right, this one isn't really needed anymore.
But I have to wonder, why a variable $(ETCDIR) is defined instead of 
hardcoding it, when it will break x2goserver, if the user should define 
it during build?
Your argument there seems to fire backwards.

Oliver
