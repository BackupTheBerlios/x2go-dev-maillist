</I>Hi Paul,
Hi List,

that&#180;s what I have done now. Im testing X2goserver-one right now to find 
out if it fits into my plans. Im looking forward to integrate it maybe  
in a primary school and so I have  to check many things to get sure of 
before Im able to &quot;roll it out&quot;.

There are a few things I was wondering about during my tests and I want 
to report it. Maybe it&#180;s my fault, but the fonts are quite small in 
Gnome. Is this a bug or do I have to reconfigure something first?

Also I have a general question: As I said before Im testing on a HP 
DL360 machine and unfortunately this machine has no soundcard at all. Is 
it possible to use the soundcard of my Client or do I have to add a 
soundcard to get this working?

The other thing I was wondering about is the performance. I know that is 
not possible to do crazy Blender stuff with a Terminalserver, but it is 
possible to watch DVD&#180;s , Youtube or things like that? I have tried it 
but it seems to stuck here. Somehow ADSL seems to be the best speed 
Configuration anyway because normal Office work or Testris ;) for 
instance stucks when I choose LAN. This happens even if Im just 
connected to the server with one client.

Best regards

</PRE>
