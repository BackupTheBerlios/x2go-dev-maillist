</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> so after all I have got LDAP working.. at least it works some kind of

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The x2goclient says something about a wrong Password and a file in

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Gnome and will try to get X2GO working as described.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hopefully it will work as I aspect. I don&#180;t know where my fault was, but 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I hope that it won&#180;t happen again in my new enviroment.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe test x2go first without LDAP.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And don't change to LDAP before it works fine...

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Paul,
</I>&gt;<i> Hi List,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> that&#180;s what I have done now. Im testing X2goserver-one right now to find 
</I>&gt;<i> out if it fits into my plans. Im looking forward to integrate it maybe  
</I>&gt;<i> in a primary school and so I have  to check many things to get sure of 
</I>&gt;<i> before Im able to &quot;roll it out&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are a few things I was wondering about during my tests and I want 
</I>&gt;<i> to report it. Maybe it&#180;s my fault, but the fonts are quite small in 
</I>&gt;<i> Gnome. Is this a bug or do I have to reconfigure something first?
</I>
Hmm, I know this problem. But I thought the bug was repaired. Are you
using the latest version?  In the past I did this:

vi /usr/bin/x2gostartagent
Direct after &quot;x2goagent&quot; on line 171 I've added &quot;-dpi 96&quot;.
-------
171c171
&lt; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$X2GO_LIB x2goagent  -$SESSION_TYPE -geometry
${X2GO_GEOMETRY} -name &quot;X2GO-${SESSION_NAME}&quot;  ${NX_AGENT}
2&gt;${SESSION_DIR}/session.log &amp;
---
&gt;<i> &gt; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$X2GO_LIB x2goagent -dpi 96 -$SESSION_TYPE -geometry
</I>${X2GO_GEOMETRY}  -name &quot;X2GO-${SESSION_NAME}&quot;  ${NX_AGENT}
2&gt;${SESSION_DIR}/session.log &amp;
184c184
--------

Do this for more documentation:
/usr/lib/x2go/x2goagent -h

&gt;<i> Also I have a general question: As I said before Im testing on a HP 
</I>&gt;<i> DL360 machine and unfortunately this machine has no soundcard at all. Is 
</I>&gt;<i> it possible to use the soundcard of my Client or do I have to add a 
</I>&gt;<i> soundcard to get this working?
</I>
Heinz wrote about this.

&gt;<i> The other thing I was wondering about is the performance. I know that is 
</I>&gt;<i> not possible to do crazy Blender stuff with a Terminalserver, but it is 
</I>&gt;<i> possible to watch DVD&#180;s , Youtube or things like that? I have tried it 
</I>&gt;<i> but it seems to stuck here. Somehow ADSL seems to be the best speed 
</I>&gt;<i> Configuration anyway because normal Office work or Testris ;) for 
</I>&gt;<i> instance stucks when I choose LAN. This happens even if Im just 
</I>&gt;<i> connected to the server with one client.
</I>
I have experiences with older versions of Nomachine NXlcient with FreeNX
what also uses NX, and my experience is that bigger moving things like
films will not be nice shown. But maybe NX has become better on this point.

Flash gives another problem (with older NX). Sometimes customers are
calling me that everything is very slow in the session. Other sessions
on the same server don't have that problem. This is always a flash
problem. I ask them to close all browser windows and the problem is
gone. They had a site with some flash open.

Another point about flash: I have heard that it uses much CPU on the
server. I have also heard that the (beta) 64-bit version is better then
the 32-bit version on this point.

With regards,
Paul van der Vlis.
