</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Hello, all.  We are trying to finish off the punch list for our first

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; One not so small issue is a problem with using the X2Go client printing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; on Windows stations.  The portability of this solution is magnificent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; but we are noticing that the windows client cannot directly print to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; local printers.  Whenever we send a print job from the X2Go server to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the Windows X2Go client (3.0.1-4), the print dialog properly displays.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; However, no matter which local printer we choose, whichever application
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Windows has associated with PDF files opens instead and displays the PDF
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; rather than printing it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Has anyone else seen this behavior? It is 100% reproducible for us.  Why
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; is this happening? Is there a workaround? We're about to dive into the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; code to see what we can find but really don't know what we are looking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; at or for so any guidance would be greatly appreciated - John
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hmm . . . I'm noticing huge ifndef Q_OS_WIN sections eliminating almost
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all of the cupsprintersettingsdialog.cpp and cupsprint.cpp files.  Am I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; beating my head against the wall trying to get the Windows client to use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the listed printers? As far as I can tell, one can't even access the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; printer settings no less print to them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does it print only to the PDF application by design? If so, why do we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bother to display all the other printers? It is very misleading to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; users. I would think there should only be a view as PDF option.  Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Hello John,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Windows Client have not support for CUPS, it using Win API function
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ShellExecute&quot; with parameters &quot;print&quot;, printer name and PDF file. In
</I>&gt;<i> this case Windows should send this file to application that associated
</I>&gt;<i> with the file type &quot;PDF&quot;. It is a task of specified application to print
</I>&gt;<i> this file. On my windows testing machine Adobe Acrobat 5.0 doing this
</I>&gt;<i> job well. However, after the document will be printed on specified
</I>&gt;<i> printer Adobe Acrobat open this document in &quot;view&quot; mode.
</I>&lt;snip&gt;
Oops! I might have misunderstood what you said.  Are you saying that,
when you send the print job to the X2Go printer and choose a specific
printer in the X2Go client print dialog, that Acrobat opens but the job
prints automatically and the only problem is that Acrobat remains open
or are you saying Acrobat opens and then you must use the Acrobat print
function manually to send the print job?

The latter is what we are seeing.  Does wapi support the ShellExecuteEx
call as opposed to ShellExecute? I'm pretty ignorant on this topic but,
from what I read this morning, it looks like ShellExecuteEx does exit
the called application when the requested action is completed.  Thanks -
John
