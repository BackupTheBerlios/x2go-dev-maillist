<PRE>Hello, all.  We have a problem with CAPS lock getting out of sync
between the physical and virtual desktops.  I assume this is the
downside of the very powerful feature of being able to change physical
computers connected to the same virtual session.  However, it is more
than annoying.  Because X2Go attempts so many logins at once (separate
SSH sessions for video, print, sound, file sharing), a wrong login
quickly exhausts grace logins and can even trip our OSSEC active
response as a perceived brute force intrusion attempt and lock out all
computers from the same site.

Perhaps password handling could be improved in two ways in X2Go.  If the
first password attempt fails, the user should be alerted and continued
login attempts for other ssh sessions should cease. Secondly, the first
failed attempt could be retried in reverse case. If it succeeds, a
message should be displayed to the user.  The problem could be either
that their physical CAPS lock is on (in which case we do nothing but
warn) or that the CAPS lock is out of sync, in which case we can offer
to toggle the CAPS lock state on the virtual desktop.  Is this possible?
Is it reasonable? Thanks - John
