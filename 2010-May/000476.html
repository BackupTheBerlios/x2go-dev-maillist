Hmm . . . I'm noticing huge ifndef Q_OS_WIN sections eliminating almost
all of the cupsprintersettingsdialog.cpp and cupsprint.cpp files.  Am I
beating my head against the wall trying to get the Windows client to use
the listed printers? As far as I can tell, one can't even access the
printer settings no less print to them.

Does it print only to the PDF application by design? If so, why do we
bother to display all the other printers? It is very misleading to the
users. I would think there should only be a view as PDF option.  Thanks
- John
