That's interesting.  I would think to enable scanning from the physical
desktop directly to the virtual desktop, i.e., from client to server,
one would have to expose the server's file system to the client (as
opposed to the current file sharing which exposes the client's file
system to the server).  That would have some very serious security
issues I think.  One of the advantages of X2Go we are selling to our
clients is the isolation of the virtual desktop from the physical thus
providing a (imperfect but helpful) barrier to malware trying to jump
from the less protected physical desktop to our highly secure virtual
desktops.

The way we do this now is an awkward, two step process of creating a
local share, scanning to that local share from the physical desktop, and
then moving the file from the share on the virtual desktop to wherever
we want it in the virtual desktop file system - John
