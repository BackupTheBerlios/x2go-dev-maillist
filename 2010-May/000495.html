<PRE>Hi all,

whilst using x2goclient on Mac OS X Snow Leopard, I came across a few
problems.

Initially, I thought I could just set up x2goclient to connect to my
server which supports public key authentication. Actually, pubkey is my
default authentication scheme when connecting to this very server and
ssh always chooses it. Furthermore, the password for this very private
key is saved in Mac OS X' keychain, providing a ssh-agent like (well,
let's say identical) environment.

First off, I guess you're only using the stock SSH client found on the
machine yourself, so why don't you let it handle it the authentication
and (optionally) query for a password, if this situation comes up?

Secondly, if you dislike this, keychain integration is still very
favorable on Mac OS X, as it saves the user the burden to provide a
password for his private key. While this is not exactly very secure,
it's very comfortable on the other hand. (Note: keychain can save the
provided password and &quot;enter&quot; it automatically everytime the privkey is
requested, but it's not necessary to do so. This said, users can of
course choose whether the password is to be remembered or not.)

I've seen that there is a way to select a private key for authentication
in x2goclient. That's handy and I like it, really. As said before, ssh
(and ssh-agent/keychain) could handle this as well, but it's nice to
have such an option, i.e. when using a very specific key for this
purpose only.

Any disagreeing or agreeing thoughts on this?

Best regards,


Mihai
