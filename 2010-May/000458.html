I've also been wowed by X2Go. The audio works very well on Windows. I
haven't played with audio on OSX yet.  There are some tricks to getting
sound to work consistently.  I keep promising documentation but have
been up to my eyeballs sorting our first major deployment.  For example,
setting Firefox/IceWeasel to use esd, setting KDE to use paplay for
sounds.

One of the things I miss about the NoMachine implementation is the
&lt;CTL&gt;&lt;ALT&gt;&lt;T&gt; sequence as a complement to the magic pixel.  I find that,
if a session mangles in full screen mode in X2Go, it is nearly
impossible to get it back.  We are tracking a problem where x2goagent
shoots to 100% CPU utilization.  When that happens, the session does not
timeout but it is completely unresponsive.  The only way to recover when
in full screen mode appears to be to either restart X or restart the
local desktop computer - neither of which are pretty if there are X apps
running on the local desktop.  Good luck and welcome - John
