&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have been looking for a suitable set-up for our high school (Swiss Gymnasium, grades 10 through 13, 400 students, 60 teachers) that would allow our students to use their own netbook/laptop in class as well as at home. Conditions are:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. no technical support for users' computers (therefore no installing  individual applications, no passing out images etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. must work on computers in any state, even with broken OS, browser whatever (so must allow terminal server solution as fall-back)
</I>&gt;<i> 3. plattform independent (win/mac/linux and independent of individual computer models)
</I>&gt;<i> 4. must work over WLAN
</I>&gt;<i> 5. should be available on- as well as off-site
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A couple of years ago I started looking more closely into LTSP and I have set up a test lab that works just fine. Though, the local nature of that makes it less suitable to our needs. Clearly, I have studied NX and now I have followed the development of X2GO more or less closely. I feel that X2GO is the perfect candidate and I want to set up a larger-scale test network. Before doing so, however, I would like to hear other people's experience with such set-ups.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have compiled a preliminary list of questions (s.b.). If you have any experience with larger scale X2GO set-ups, I would really appreciate your input and I think others might be interested as well. Thanks a lot for sharing your expertise! If you would like to communicate in German or French, I can cope with both.
</I>
I have only experience with small scale setups. I will answer only some
questions.

&gt;<i> Cheers!
</I>&gt;<i> St. M&#252;ller, Switzerland
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> QUESTIONS (yes/no, experience?)
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Local OS:
</I>&gt;<i> a) Copy/Paste from/to local OS
</I>
Works fine.

&gt;<i> b) Accessing local file systems
</I>&gt;<i> c) Support of local USB devices
</I>&gt;<i> d) Sound
</I>&gt;<i> e) Printing on local printer
</I>&gt;<i> f) Printing on local network printer / on remote network printer
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Set-Up, Administration:
</I>&gt;<i> a) number of server / user (50, 100, 150
</I>&gt;<i> concurrent sessions)
</I>&gt;<i> b) Load Balancing, Cluster
</I>&gt;<i> c) Manageability of several parallel servers in administration
</I>&gt;<i> d) Band with
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> e)  Multimedia (Flash)
</I>
Little flash animations are no problem, but bigger flash like films are
too slow. Flash can make a user-session very slow, when people call me
about a slow desktop I ask them to close all browser windows. In most
cases it was flash and the problem is gone then.

&gt;<i> f) Compatibility with Terminal Server
</I>&gt;<i> (LTSP) on same server or is X2GO usable also as directly as terminal server?
</I>
I expect you can use LTSP and X2go on the same server, but X2go is
really different. X2go is usuable directly without LTSP.

X2go works trough SSH and don't uses a display manager (e.g. GDM).

I will advise you to install and try it. You can make a one-node
installation in about 10 minutes:
<A HREF="http://www.x2go.org/fileadmin/doc/installation_x2go_debian_en.html">http://www.x2go.org/fileadmin/doc/installation_x2go_debian_en.html</A>
A one-node installation is not what you want, but you will learn a lot
about how X2go works and it's very easy to install.

You could use a live-CD to test it, e.g.:
<A HREF="http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current-live/i386/iso-cd/debian-live-504-i386-gnome-desktop.iso">http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current-live/i386/iso-cd/debian-live-504-i386-gnome-desktop.iso</A>

&gt;<i> g) Mounting homes from data server
</I>&gt;<i> h) Compatibility with administration servers (LDAP, ADS etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> i) Acess protection, security
</I>
With regards,
Paul van der Vlis.
