&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have been looking for a suitable set-up for our high school (Swiss Gymnasium, grades 10 through 13, 400 students, 60 teachers) that would allow our students to use their own netbook/laptop in class as well as at home. Conditions are:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. no technical support for users' computers (therefore no installing  individual applications, no passing out images etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. must work on computers in any state, even with broken OS, browser whatever (so must allow terminal server solution as fall-back)
</I>&gt;<i> 3. plattform independent (win/mac/linux and independent of individual computer models)
</I>&gt;<i> 4. must work over WLAN
</I>&gt;<i> 5. should be available on- as well as off-site
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A couple of years ago I started looking more closely into LTSP and I have set up a test lab that works just fine. Though, the local nature of that makes it less suitable to our needs. Clearly, I have studied NX and now I have followed the development of X2GO more or less closely. I feel that X2GO is the perfect candidate and I want to set up a larger-scale test network. Before doing so, however, I would like to hear other people's experience with such set-ups.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>We also initially looked at LTSP but realized it would not meet our
remote access requirements.  We were planning to use NoMachine's
solution even though we would have liked a fully open source solution
but found major issues with sound (esd based).  We then thought of
wrapping NX inside of some scripting and using pulseaudio for sound
outside of NX and that's when we stumbled across X2Go.

We are planning a very substantial installation but are still quite
small - about 15 to 18 desktops.  We are planning to scale to many
thousands.  Our environment is a bit different.  X2Go is normally used
as one server to many desktops.  We were concerned about how certain
protocols would behave in the shared desktop environment, e.g., SIP and
VNC.  We did not want to invest in building an entire company around
many-to-one service only to find a necessary protocol failed in such an
environment.

Thus, we combined X2Go with VServer to create a one-to-one ratio between
X2Go servers and clients.  The VServer hashification feature means we
add minimal disk and RAM overhead per X2Go server.

Our first server was quite - two quad core CPUs, 32GB RAM, an iSCSI SAN.
The current load is barely taxing the CPU.  RAM is a little more of a
concern as we are chewing through it faster than expected.  We were
originally told by an NX consultant that we could get 20 users per GB or
RAM.  We thought that was pushing it and estimated 10.  However, we are
finding individual users using 300 - 1000 MB each.  I'm not sure if the
per user value will drop as we add more users.  The VServer
hashification is supposed to enable a single page in memory for all
duplicates.  We did notice that much of this memory is the X2Go cache.
I do not yet know if this is tunable and may be the disadvantage of the
1-to-1 server/client ratio, i.e., potentially hundreds of caches when we
would have had one.  I have not investigated creating a shared cache and
am concerned of the security implications of such a thing.  I should
mention that the dedicated 1:1 approach with fixed IP addresses is very
nice for schools so violations of access policy can be accurately
tracked to a user without trying to match logs with DHCP lease times.

We have rewritten some of the scripts to combine processes.  We stopped
the x2gocleansessions process on all clients and created one master
process on the vserver host to clean all the clients.  We also altered
the printing scripts to enable the central cups print server to service
multiple x2go servers.

Finally, we run a single database instance for all clients.  This also
involved some patching of the scripts as we did not want the clients
accessing the database as the postgres super-user.

Out first deployment is almost finished and we hope to share our
configurations with the community soon.
&gt;<i> I have compiled a preliminary list of questions (s.b.). If you have any experience with larger scale X2GO set-ups, I would really appreciate your input and I think others might be interested as well. Thanks a lot for sharing your expertise! If you would like to communicate in German or French, I can cope with both.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers!
</I>&gt;<i> St. M&#252;ller, Switzerland
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> QUESTIONS (yes/no, experience?)
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Local OS:
</I>We have successfully run using several distributions of Linux and
Windows.  We have done some preliminary testing with Mac and it seemed
to work after tweaking a couple of the X settings - I don't recall which
right now although one was to enable full screen.

We are having a problem with full screen mode in Windows - it does not
work.  I suspect there is some kind of --fullscreen parameter which is
not being passed to Xming.  I haven't looked at this yet but need to do
so soon as it is confusing the Windows users and prevents iterating over
open windows in the X2Go desktop by using the alt-tab key.
&gt;<i> a) Copy/Paste from/to local OS
</I>Works reasonably well with Linux local OS with some inconsistencies.  It
is virtually unusable in Windows.
&gt;<i> b) Accessing local file systems
</I>This seems to work very reliably although we had to do major hacking of
the scripts to get it to work in the VServer environment because we
intentionally limit the POSIX capabilities of the x2go client vservers.
We posted an possible issue with Windows systems earlier today on the
list. It is not properly cleaning up the created desktop icons.  This
may be peculiar to our environment.

We have noticed that file transfers to the X2Go server are producing
inordinate I/O wait.  I believe this is not an X2Go issue but is
peculiar to our iSCSI intiator.  I'd be very curious to know if others
are seeing this.

We also have noticed a problem with Windows profiles.  One client has
stored Windows user directories (e.g., My Documents) on their server.
The data store is not reference by a drive letter and shows up in the
X2Go client file system browser simply as My Documents.  It will not
share with the x2go server.  Anything with a drive letter including
network drives and removable media shares fine. 
&gt;<i> c) Support of local USB devices
</I>This is a very nice feature in X2Go - particularly how one can create
the share dynamically within a session.  One problem we have in the
VServer environment is that we cannot unmount them from within the x2go
client.  The fusermount -u command requires a namespace capability that
we cannot grant without granting the SYS_ADMIN capability which we
refuse to do for security reasons.  This may be fixed in newer kernels.
we are running 2.6.28.
&gt;<i> d) Sound
</I>This can be a maddening problem.  The short answer is that it works
well.  However, it is almost application by application warfare.  For
example, Kaffeine defaulted to using pulseaudio and worked almost out of
the box.  The shortcomings were, again, our virtualized infrastructure
where the underlying guest did not have direct access to the sound
hardware.  KDE sounds did not work even when we set artSd to use ESD.
Instead, we manually edited the knotifyrc file to call paplay instead of
esdplay and upgraded the libsndfile1 to the Squeeze version (the Lenny
version did not play .ogg files).  Once we did that, KDE sounds jumped
to life.  On the other hand, we have yet to get Firefox/Iceweasel to
play sounds.  Any time we make the recommended changes to use pulse
audio or alsa as the default sound system, firefox seg faults.
Flash did seem to work but has since stopped working.  We suspect that
is because another required package from Squeeze disabled libasound32
and that package may be required for the flash plugin sound.
&gt;<i> e) Printing on local printer
</I>The cups-x2go printer is an excellent solution.  We are picking up a few
issues.  On Windows systems, it seems not matter what printer we choose,
the print job is opened by whatever application is associated with pdf
files.  We have not yet started to troubleshoot this issue.  We also
noticed that the x2goclient printing is NOT seeing the printers provided
by the local Windows print server.  It is seeing locally installed
network printers.
&gt;<i> f) Printing on local network printer / on remote network printer
</I>See previous answer
&gt;<i> 2) Set-Up, Administration:
</I>&gt;<i> a) number of server / user (50, 100, 150
</I>&gt;<i> concurrent sessions)
</I>&gt;<i> b) Load Balancing, Cluster
</I>This is a near term project but we have not yet addressed clustering and
load balancing.  We may try to do this at the VServer rather than X2Go
level.
&gt;<i> c) Manageability of several parallel servers in administration
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> d) Band with
</I>We have been a little surprised by bandwidth requirements.  When
tethering via cell phone to an EDGE network, we are noticing very, very
sluggish performance.  Of course, most other solutions would not be
usable at all! X2Go seems more latency sensitive than bandwidth
sensitive.  That may be more the issue with the EDGE networks.

We have seen X2Go perform well with up to around 3% packet loss.  Higher
than that and it starts to lag badly from upper layer retransmissions.
Between 10% and 15%, it starts to become unusable.  Again, other
solutions break completely well before then.

We have noticed problems in highly congested networks.  It is almost as
if the packets are delivered out of order as the typed sequences are out
of order.  However, we also noticed that the sequences are out of order
with repeating characters.  Since it is highly unlikely that TCP is
ultimately delivering packets our of sequence, we wonder if this is some
kind of compression or optimization logic gone awry.

We have not done analysis on it but it anecdotally appears that wireless
network can show serious degradation over wired networks.  I suppose
this is probably due to packet loss on a wireless network which, for
normal data transfers is not noticeable but, since each keystroke is a
data packet (I assume), lost packets can result in delayed character
display.  This can be annoying to fast typists or those who type by
sight.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> e)  Multimedia (Flash)
</I>As others have mentioned, X2Go is not well suited to delivering video.
My limited understanding is that the algorithms used to optimize the
kind of screen refresh required for passing typical application screens
is very different from that used to transmit video (besides the sheer
bandwidth issue).  We have noticed that changing the compression setting
from the default 16m-jpeg to 16m-png-jpeg seems to make a substantial
difference in both clarity and performance.  We are continuing to
investigate optimizing the somewhat laggard screen refresh offered by
NX.
&gt;<i> f) Compatibility with Terminal Server
</I>&gt;<i> (LTSP) on same server or is X2GO usable also as directly as terminal server?
</I>&gt;<i> g) Mounting homes from data server
</I>This is where the X2Go/Vserver combination shines.  Because VServer
provides a single file system, we do not use a separate file server.
The data is stored on an iSCSI SAN and mounted as a local file system on
the VServer host.  This is then remounted using mount bind to all the
various guests so that the file system semantics are always those of a
local file system and we never encounter NFS/SMB issues.  We have had to
battle latency issues on the SAN because of the default 4KB page size in
Linux.
&gt;<i> h) Compatibility with administration servers (LDAP, ADS etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> i) Acess protection, security
</I>We are not using much security within X2Go.  We have not restricted
users in x2goserver.conf.  We do completely isolate users from the
server farm with as needed, micro-perimeter security via the ISCS
project (<A HREF="http://iscs.sourceforge.net">http://iscs.sourceforge.net</A>).  We are able to identify users by
IP address as these are fixed per virtual machine and each X2Go desktop
is tied to a specific virtual machine.  We also severely limit the POSIX
capabilities of each virtual machine (e.g., they cannot put interfaces
into promiscuous mode, have limited access to /proc, etc.) and do not
allow root access even via sudo (which has created some interesting work
arounds where applications assume root access is available).

I hope that gives some idea of the capabilities and limitations of X2Go.
It is an outstanding project and we look forward to it improving with
age and as the development community grows - John
