<PRE>Dear x2go Listers

I've found out about x2go at the Dornbirn Linuxday. I've installed
x2goserver-home at work on a Ubuntu 8.04 server with a 2.6.24-24-generic
#1 SMP - Kernel on a 64 bit machine. Ubuto 9.10 runs on the client with
a 2.6.31-14-generic 32 bit machine.

Using a Gnome-Session everything run's pretty smooth. The
sound-forwarding is nothing short of amazing.
Unfortunatly one of my co-workers insist on using a &quot;Single
Apllication&quot;-Session. We use Eclipse 3.5.1 which is started from a
&quot;Single Application&quot; Terminal.
It works, but I have two problems:
- Even without Eclipse, the Terminal get's dimmed by Compiz, which it
does to all &quot;unresponsive&quot; Application. I don't know how
'responsiveness' is measured by Compiz. The Terminal and Eclipse of
course *are* responsive. I've got a workaround though so this isn't so
bad. I've changed the Compiz settings under &quot;Effekte&quot; -&gt; &quot;Fenser ein- /
ausblenden&quot; -&gt; &quot;Dim Unresponsive Windows&quot; to &quot;off&quot;
- The second problem is after some time (sometimes 15-30 Minutes,
sometimes up until 2 hours) working with Eclipse the session gets closed
without prompting any error. Running the x2goclient in a local terminal
I see the messages: &quot;&quot;&quot;
QProcess: Destroyed while process is still running.
QProcess: Destroyed while process is still running.
QProcess: Destroyed while process is still running.
check command message
&quot;&quot;&quot;

I can then reopen my (now suspended) session without any problems. But
it's very annoying being forced to reopen the session ever so often.

I don't know how to get further information about this. I can't find any
log-files about it. The output on the STDERR (STDOUT?) was the only
thing I could find.

On the server (Ubuntu 8.04) I got the following Versions installed
x2goagent 3.4.0-3-1
x2goserver 3.0.1-2
x2goserver-home 3.0.1-1
x2goserver-one 3.0.1-1
from deb <A HREF="http://apt-cacher.cube.ch:3142/x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/">http://apt-cacher.cube.ch:3142/x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/</A>
lenny main

On the client (Ubuntu 9.10)
x2goclient 3.01-5
from deb <A HREF="http://apt-cacher.cube.ch:3142/x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/">http://apt-cacher.cube.ch:3142/x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/</A>
lenny main

Greetings
Paul
