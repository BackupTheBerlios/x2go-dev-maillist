I just tried out x2goclient-4.0.1.2-pre02 and I'm a little disappointed.

1) There's no improvement on the sound issue (Flash videos sound 
&quot;choppy&quot;), yet there's no additional download option where one could 
download a copy of x2goclient-4.0.1.2-pre02-setup that is set to use the 
old pulseaudio. :-( Showstopper for me, can't roll that out to my customers.

2) Even with the newer Xserver that is included in 
x2goclient-4.0.1.2-pre02-setup, Chromium and Chrome still crash at 
random intervals. To be exact, they're not crashing themselves, they're 
crashing the X server. Pausing and resuming a session lets you continue 
where you stopped, yet, this is an instability that users won't put up 
with since they quit Windows 98/Millennium for good. It's only when X2Go 
is involved that these crashes occur - if you export the display with 
ssh (from PuTTY) instead of using x2goclient.exe, Chromium and Chrome 
behave well. Not a showstopper (customers are using Iceweasel so far), 
but something where I had hoped to see some improvement with the new 
Xserver. :-(

3) The two items above are connected in a way: Flash sound isn't 
&quot;choppy&quot; in Chromium/Chrome, so if we'd get Chromium/Chrome to work, I 
could try to migrate my users away from Iceweasel to avoid the sound 
issue. On the other hand, if you are able to fix the sound issue, I 
don't see a need to migrate to Chromium/Chrome.

4) New Eye Candy #1: The taskbar icon suddenly changes into the seal 
icon once the connection is established. Please add a checkbox/config 
file entry to disable this. I'm sure it will confuse users who have 
previously used published application mode and look for the &quot;Accelerated 
X&quot; icon that has just vanished. I'm kind of disappointed that we're 
adding silly eye candy when there still are serious bugs to fix.

5) New Eye Candy #2: Upon connection, an info bubble pops up, containing 
a *totally cryptic session name* and disappearing after five seconds or 
so. No non-technical user can make use of that message, seriously. And 
even technical users will have a hard time memorizing a cryptic session 
name within 5 seconds. Please, also add an option to disable this popup, 
and seriously consider changing the displayed info to something more 
userfriendly like &quot;Connection to host &lt;host&gt;, session &lt;sessionname&gt; 
established as user &lt;user&gt;.&quot; It's okay to add the cryptic string 
somewhere where techies can find it if they need it, maybe in an 
About-Box or so, but please - think of the chil^W ordinary non-technical 
end user.
And again, I'm kind of disappointed that we're adding silly eye candy 
when there still are serious bugs to fix.

@Mike&amp;Mike (or is that Mike&#178;?):
I'm guessing this should go into the bugtracker, somehow. Please advise 
on how it should be tagged and I'll turn items 1, 2, 4, and 5 into four 
new bugtracker entries.
