     + Clear (Fedora package) changelog.
     + Make package build on Fedora/EPEL versions that do not have the
       qtbrowserplugin package.
     + For EPEL-5 builds: replace full path to qmake-qt4 and lrelease.
     + Split up package into bin:packages: x2goclient, x2goplugin,
       x2goplugin-provider.
     + Make sure lrelease-qt4 is executed (not just lrelease).
