&gt;<i> Whatever solution we choose has to work within the existing environment

</I>
Well, guys, it's 2013, almost 2014, and we live in the Post-NSA-Scandal 
world. The times of using &quot;xhost +&quot; and not having to worry about it are 
long over. Do yourself a favor and change your scripts.


&gt;<i> I acknowledge that there is a security issue with TCP connections in
</I>&gt;<i> X11, but that is an architectural issue with X11 itself and not with
</I>&gt;<i> X2Go per se. If the developers of X2Go were to make TCP connections
</I>&gt;<i> impossible then effectively the defined security model of X11 (as
</I>&gt;<i> documented in places like the XSecurity and Xauth man pages) would be
</I>&gt;<i> broken. TCP is part of how X11 works.
</I>
As a side-note, I hope you're aware that those newfangled GUI thingies 
like Wayland and Mir are ditching TCP in their core design?  Just sayin' 
(I don't like them, either) - not that that comes to bite you in the 
lower back in a few years when you don't expect it.


&gt;<i> Once it became apparent in our testing that exporting displays didn't
</I>&gt;<i> work as expected, the system administrator who installed it went through
</I>&gt;<i> the configuration files and documentation looking for a solution. He
</I>&gt;<i> couldn't find one, so he escalated it to me to look into. If we hadn't
</I>&gt;<i> been able to find a fix it would have ruled out X2Go from further
</I>&gt;<i> consideration, which would have been unfortunate as it is currently our
</I>&gt;<i> leading choice for this particular need.
</I>
In my opinion, Mike is a bit too customer-friendly here by turning your 
request into a wishlist item that lets every newbie shoot him-/herself 
in the foot, security-wise, by toggling a setting in the configuration.
Sorry, but I've seen way too many people go &quot;chmod 777 -R /*&quot; as soon as 
something doesn't work as expected, and I'm fearing the same for an 
easily reachable option to allow TCP connections - because &quot;xhost +&quot; is 
the X/TCP equivalent of &quot;chmod 777 -R /*&quot; in the filesystem.

Of course, everybody is free to shoot him-/herself in the foot, that's 
why it's Linux - but merely leaving a &quot;this is dangerous&quot; note next to 
the parameter is like sticking a tag &quot;please don't use this unless you 
know what you're doing&quot; on a loaded 12-gauge in a room full of toddlers.


&gt;<i> Hopefully the above helps persuade you that there is a need for some
</I>&gt;<i> users to be able to continue to support the existing X11 security model
</I>&gt;<i> (including TCP).
</I>
Sorry, but you don't have me convinced that this is something anyone 
should use for a prolonged period of time.


&gt;<i> If you accept that point, then it seems there should be a more elegant
</I>&gt;<i> way of enabling TCP than editing the x2gostartagent file. As someone
</I>&gt;<i> brand new to looking at the project, files like x2goagent.options or
</I>&gt;<i> x2goserver.conf are the obvious places I would expect to find an option
</I>&gt;<i> to make this change.
</I>
My understanding of the issue is: It's possible to allow TCP 
connections, and the fact that it's not easily reachable - but can be 
reached - is a Good Thing(TM).
We should leave it that way.
You can manually allow TCP connections in your environment to ease 
transition to X2Go - but by all means, go ahead and fix your scripts so 
they use ssh -X/-Y, and do that soon. And reconfigure X2Go to &quot;nolisten 
TCP&quot; the second you're done fixing your scripts.
