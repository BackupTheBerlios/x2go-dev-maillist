Weird. But thanks for the forward ...

... though waiting a few hours, especially when most of these hours are 
nighttime in my time zone, sounds like the easier approach. ;-)

I can't promise I'll get around to test a new version tomorrow, anyways, 
and it's not like the old ones currently in use by my customers are 
going to expire and cease working any time soon. ;-)

By the way, since you're new to the project, maybe you can bring some 
fresh ideas to the table - the whole sound issue has been stuck for 
quite a while. Not onl is pulseaudio creating choppy sound when playing 
Flash videos, it's also less than ideal for transmitting sound over 
low-bandwidth WAN links (I'm not a coder, but I believe I remember one 
of the coders involved mentioning that pulseaudio always pushes the 
original bit and sample rate &quot;down the pipe&quot; and doesn't adapt to the 
available bandwith like the graphics part of X2Go does, where you can 
change bit depth, compression, etc.).
So if you have an idea on what we could replace pulseaudio with, shoot! 
:<i>-) Just remember, we need client software for Linux, Windows and Mac 
</I>OS. My main concern would be playback, but you shouldn't forget that 
there's also the faint chance that somebody wants to use the microphone 
on the client and forward its sound to an application on the server.
