<PRE>Hi guys,

I can succesfully build the DMG on my MacBook (OSX 10.8). I have gone with
MacPorts instead of Homebrew, since installing nxcomp/nxproxy with Homebrew
isn't straightforward currently. The macbuild.sh script creates a nice dmg
for me, and it works fine on my system. However, when I try it on a
different system, which doesn't have XCode and MacPorts, it won't start at
all. It gives an error report which boils down to it not being able to load
the dependent libraries. Specifically it tries to load
/opt/local/lib/libcrypto-1.0.0.dylib which doesn't exist on this other
system. It is x2goclient.app/Contents/Frameworks/libssl-1.0.0.dylib which
references it.
The official dmg released by Clemens works fine, it is only my build of it,
which has problems. Why does in try to load libcrypto-1.0.0.dylib from /opt
instead of the on included in Contents/Frameworks? (I have checked,
libcrypto-1.0.0.dylib IS in there).

I am on a completely clean install of newest MacPorts and have nothing
except x2goclient+deps installed there.

And no, just using the official DMG isn't currently an option as we want to
provide a simple way for our users to access our new x2gobroker setup. If
we don't customize the startup script, they would have to start it from a
cmd-line with --broker-url args. This first build however hasn't been
customized at all. It is just the official 4.0.0.4 source tarball with no
changes.
