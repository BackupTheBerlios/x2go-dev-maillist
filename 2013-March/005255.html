</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> May I suggest something?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  From what I have read in this thread, the problem is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    o you want X2Go installable on RHEL
</I>&gt;<i>    o the only person doing the RPMs does not have a machine with RHEL to test
</I>&gt;<i>      his packages on
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> @Jan: would it make sense that Daniel provided you with a login on a  
</I>&gt;<i> RHEL machine? Whould that help?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If so, can the two of you please get together?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> @Daniel: some background info.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, the people coding X2Go (Alex, me, Heinz, Morty,  
</I>&gt;<i> Reinhard, Arw, ...) tend to run on Debian (or Ubuntu) monoculture  
</I>&gt;<i> sites, only. I personally changed over to .deb packaged distros more  
</I>&gt;<i> than 10 years ago. On the other hand I have just become Debian  
</I>&gt;<i> Developer, so that is the packaging style I focus on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to Jan and his employer (who pays for it) we have RPM packages  
</I>&gt;<i> for concurrent RPM-based distros. Note that Jan at the time of writing  
</I>&gt;<i> rather is on the periphery of the project, simply providing the RPMs  
</I>&gt;<i> and (very good) patches. The packaging is not so much an upstream  
</I>&gt;<i> issue, as you might guess.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, actually you are absolutely free (as an alternative) to package  
</I>&gt;<i> for RHEL yourself and provide a download URL on our website. That is  
</I>&gt;<i> one realm of possibilities. Another surely is to arrange with Jan to  
</I>&gt;<i> cooperate on the RPM pacakges.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that you want X2Go to be spread around the global and  
</I>&gt;<i> also make it available on business Linux distros (like RHEL). Thanks  
</I>&gt;<i> for that disposition and maybe there is a niche for you to help out in  
</I>&gt;<i> our project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> light+love,
</I>&gt;<i> Mike
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Thank you for the info Mike it is much appreciated. It has given me a good 
understanding on 
to how you guys work with the different distros. Also sorry if I caused upset. I 
am happy to 
help Jan out if he requires my help. I do not have RHEL but do have a CentOS 
server which is 
binary compatible so testing on that would work well.

My current understanding of the issue is as follows. 

nxagent-3.5.0.17-3.1.x86_64 is asking for a dependency that is only available on 
OpenSuse 
which is xorg-x11-fonts-core. I believe this issue was resolved however when the 
rpm's 
attempted to be built it failed for some reason. Because of this the rpm's in 
the repo for 
RHEL_6 have not updated.

I believe this is the current error:

[  669s] RPM build errors:
[  669s]     Bad exit status from /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.tWnA7V (%install)

I have tried to install other version of nxagent from fedora 17 and 18 just in 
case this 
would work with no success.

I am not sure if me giving Jan access to a server would help in this case. But I 
am happy to 
do this if it would help. A recommendation for Jan if he doesn't have any access 
to an RHEL 
system might be to use something like Virtualbox and create a CentOS Virtual 
Machine. This 
will make it very easy to test x2go on RHEL based systems.

@Jan Please feel free to email me if I can be of any assistance. Thank you
