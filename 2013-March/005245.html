<PRE>2013/3/12 Moritz Struebe &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">Moritz.Struebe at informatik.uni-erlangen.de</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Ok, I followed this only biefly, but is this a fight who is allowed to
</I>&gt;<i> package X2Go? IMO if we can (in terms of manpower) package for a distro
</I>&gt;<i> upstream that is good. If we have a packager downstream the better.
</I>&gt;<i> After all that person is free to adjust the upstream packing to his/her
</I>&gt;<i> likes or provide patches to the upstram packaging to make his/her life
</I>&gt;<i> easier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or did I miss the point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Well, of course anyone may package any software for any OS as long as
the license allows to do so.

Perhaps my point didn't come across.
My point is, I'm just not a fan of third party packages. I've seen to
much bad ones as I went along and I've seen too much Windows style
&quot;let's download software from some site in the web and try to install
it somehow&quot;, that is just not the way it works using GNU/Linux.
Of course it is nice, when upstream projects do package their stuff
and I'm always basing my distro packages on the upstream srpms, if
they are available and if they are not crap (which I've seen as well
over the years).
My problem is the &quot;rpm-based distros&quot; part.
As I see it, packaging for any and all rpm based distros at the same
time is just not possible. Of course you can package for some of them
at the same time using OBS, but then you will just have some rpm
packages and you should note that somewhere.
The way user's minds work is &quot;There is a rpm package, I can't install
it on my distro, so that distro must have some serious problems&quot;, even
if the problem is just the package was not built for that distro...
