<PRE>Hi there,

X2go Git
========
as many of you might have realized X2go development has moved to Git  
based development. The Git development site can be found here:
<A HREF="http://git.x2go.org">http://git.x2go.org</A>

Not all X2go packages are available in this Git repository, but we  
will move more and more packages there whenever we (or you) think that  
work on it should be continued in Git. We are very happy about people  
contributing coding work at this point.

Projects available as Git projects on git.x2go.org are nightly-built  
for Ubuntu GNU/Linux (as Moritz has announced a couple of days ago).  
Thx to Reinhard+Moritz for this...:
<A HREF="https://launchpad.net/~x2go/+archive/ppa">https://launchpad.net/~x2go/+archive/ppa</A>

Ubuntu Packages for Trying-Out X2go
===============
So, for Ubuntu we currently _only_ have nightly builds. These nightly  
builds are for testing purposes during development only. Use them at  
your own risk or rather do not use them without discussing the state  
of code on this mailing list first. Nightly-builds might not be stable  
every once in a while. They are built directly from the X2go Git repos  
-- no matter how broken the code there might be... Currently, you are  
lucky, to my knowledge all packages build and install well.

We lately have started a discussion if there should be packages at our  
Launchpad ppa that reflect a rather ,,stable'' state opposed to the  
nightly-builds. I think we should continue this discussion...


Debian Packages for Trying-Out X2go
===============
For Debian I have set up a new reprepro package repository at this URL  
over the weekend:
<A HREF="http://code.x2go.org/debian">http://code.x2go.org/debian</A>

Preferrably, the URL will be renamed to:
<A HREF="http://packages.x2go.org/debian">http://packages.x2go.org/debian</A>

...but I need a DNS entry from Heinz for that. (PING!)

On <A HREF="http://code.x2go.org/debian">http://code.x2go.org/debian</A> we have to component areas: ,,main''  
and ,,heuler''.

   main: packages reflecting the Git-tag ,,build-main'' (refer to individual
         projects on git.x2go.org)
   heuler: nightly-builds (not quite yet, currently I have to start the build
           process manually)

Notes on ,,main'': Packages in the main area we consider as relatively  
stable. As long as X2go is not available in Debian itself, you  
probably might try those.

Notes on ,,heuler'': you do _NOT_ want to use nightly-builds for your  
systems, especially not for production systems. These nightly-builds  
(cf. Ubuntu nightly-builds) are for developmental testing only. The  
heuler repos is/will be really experimental stuff. Please keep that in  
mind.

BUILDING PROCESS
=================
All packages in the new Debian package repos (similar to Launchpad for  
Ubuntu) get built against clean Debian chroots. They are built with  
qemubuilder (a pbuilder/cowbuilder derivative). We currently support  
i386 and amd64 architectures for Debian only. For testing, we  
currently only need those architectures. If there is need for other  
archs like powerpc, armel, ... please let us know. We may consider to  
build the packages in ,,main'' area for these not so common  
archictectures, too, if there is a need for that (I have never tested  
if they work on those archs, though).

As they are a couple of open issues around package building, I will  
send a couple of subsequent mails, touching those issues, so stay  
tuned...

light+love,
Mike
