X2Go uses SSH for remote connections, as a result SSH needs to be
restricted [on a per user basis] to allow [some subcommands of] X2Go only.
In this case X2Go must not allow opening a shell.

</I>
I don't see how apparmor can be used to do this, but then I have not yet
tried it. AFAIUI apparmor is used to confine a single application.
Confining sshd this way for every user would remove the usual remote
administration access.

&gt;<i> Again I confess that I've not taken a lot of time to digest this issue

</I>&gt;<i> x2go.conf (or whatever file we are using for configuration)? - John
</I>
The application confined by apparmor must not be allowed to have any
influence on apparmor, because apparmor shall confine cracked applications.
So X2Go must not be allowed any say in the applicability of an apparmor
profile.

AFAIUI Dick does not want to elevate access rights, which can be done
using sudo, but further restrict the SSH (secure shell) access. The
latter can be done by allowing just one (or a few) command(s) via the
authorized_keys file of SSH. If some wrapper script shall be used,
care must be taken to introduce no new holes.

It could be worth to investigate giving the x2go users a restricted shell
(e.g. rbash).

Erik
