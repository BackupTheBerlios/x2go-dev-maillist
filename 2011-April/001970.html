</I>&lt;snip&gt;
Again I confess that I've not taken a lot of time to digest this issue
but, I wonder if the back and forth is cause because for some users,
this would be a highly desirable feature whereas, for others, it not
only makes no sense but would be a significant obstacle.  Can it be
built as a configurable option that can be enabled with a setting in
x2go.conf (or whatever file we are using for configuration)? - John
