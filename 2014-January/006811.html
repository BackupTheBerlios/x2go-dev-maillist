X2Go Component: src:python-x2go
Version: 0.4.0.9-0x2go1
Status: RELEASE
Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2014 15:14:16 +0100
Fixes: 329 330 335
Changes: 
 python-x2go (0.4.0.9-0x2go1) RELEASED; urgency=low
 .
   [ Mike Gabriel ]
   * New upstream version (0.4.0.9):
     - Agent channels in Paramiko can raise an EOFError if the connection
       has got disrupted. Ignoring this.
     - Store the session password in base64 encoded string in order to make
       it harder spotting the long term stored (for the duration of the session)
       plain text password.
     - Support encryption passphrases on SSH private key files (X2Go SSH
       connections as well as SSH proxy connections).
     - Invalidate SSH private keys (filename, pkey object) when look_for_keys is
       requested.
     - Keep private key information even if force_password_auth is set in the
       control session's connect() method.
     - Fix parameter handling in X2GoSession.connect().
     - Rewrite passwords that are not string/unicode to an empty string.
     - No Unicode chars in log messages. Eliminated one more in checkhosts.py.
     - Implement two-factor authentication.
     - Compat fix in _paramiko monkey patch module to also work with early
       Paramiko versions.
     - Handle echoing ~/.*shrc files gracefully via SSH client connections. Do
       not allow data injections via ~/.*shrc files. (Fixes: #335).
     - Properly handle (=expand) the &quot;~&quot; character in key filenames. (Brought to
       attention by Eldamir on IRC. Thanks!).
     - Differentiate between desktop sharing errors and desktop sharing access
       that gets denied by the other/remote user.
     - Report about found session window / session window retitling in debug
       mode.
     - Fix session window detection when local session manager is the i3 session
       manager (which uses _NET_CLIENT_LIST_STACKING instead of
       _NET_CLIENT_LIST).
     - Check for pulse cookie file in old (~/.pulse-cookie) and new
       (~/.config/pulse/cookie) location.
     - Import python-x2go-py3.patch from Fedora. Thanks to Orion!!!
     - Improve setup.py script: make it run with Python3 and older Python2
       versions.
     - Fix tests for two-factor authentication in control session and SSH proxy
       code.
     - Fix regression: Make password logins with PyHoca-CLI succeed again.
     - Make channel compression to all authentication methods.
     - Set keepalive on proxy channel.
     - Only use [&lt;host&gt;]:&lt;port&gt; if &lt;port&gt; is not 22.
     - Handle host key checks for hosts that do not have a port specified.
   * debian/source/format:
     + Switch to format 1.0.
   * python-x2go.spec:
     + Ship python-x2go.spec (RPM package definitions) in upstream project.
       (Thanks to the Fedora package maintainers).
     + Clear (Fedora package) changelog.
     + Drop dependency on python-cups.
 .
   [ Orion Poplawski ]
   * debian/control:
     + Drop python-cups from Depends: field. Python CUPS is no dependency if
       Python X2Go. (Fixes: #329).
 .
   [ Kenneth Pedersen ]
   * New upstream version (0.4.0.9):
     - Color depth detection: Stop using win32api.GetSystemMetrics(2) which actually
       returns the width of a vertical scroll bar in pixels. Instead, create a screen
       display context and query it for the color depth. (Fixes: #330).
