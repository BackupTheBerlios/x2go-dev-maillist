X2Go Component: src:x2goserver
Version: 4.0.1.10-0x2go1
Status: RELEASE
Date: Fri, 03 Jan 2014 11:34:36 +0100
Fixes: 354 355
Changes: 
 x2goserver (4.0.1.10-0x2go1) RELEASED; urgency=low
 .
   * New upstream version (4.0.1.10):
     - Fix x2goresume-session. The several parameters placed into the NX options
       file are expected by x2goresume-session at very specific positions. This
       we broke by trying to fix the fullscreen/geometry issue in x2gostartagent.
       Thanks to Harvey Eneman for tracking this down!!! (Fixes: #355).
     - x2goserver-fmbindings/Makefile: install x2gofm.
     - x2goserver-fmbindings/Makefile: install share/applications and share/mime.
     - x2goserver-printing/Makefile: create feature.d directory before installing
       files into it.
     - Handle TCP listening of x2goagent in x2goagent.options. (Fixes: #354).
     - Clean up Makefiles, remove commented out lines.
     - Use xkb ruleset 'base' rather than xfree86 as on RHEL systems the
       xfree86 symlink to base ruleset does not exist.
     - Grab systemd service file from Fedora and ship it upstream.
     - Provide RHEL/Fedora support in x2goserver-xsession.
     - Only sanity check for existence of /etc/x2go/Xsession.d on Debian
       (derived) systems.
     - Provide man page for x2goserver.conf.
   * x2goserver.spec:
     + Ship x2goserver.spec (RPM package definitions) in upstream project.
       (Thanks to the Fedora package maintainers). File differs from the Fedora
       file already.
     + Add init script for RPM based distro. Taken from the Fedora
       package.
     + Clear (Fedora package) changelog.
</PRE>
