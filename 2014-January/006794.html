X2Go Component: src:x2goserver
Version: 4.0.0.8-0x2go1
Status: RELEASE
Date: Fri, 03 Jan 2014 11:30:54 +0100
Fixes: 347 356
Changes: 
 x2goserver (4.0.0.8-0x2go1) RELEASED; urgency=low
 .
   * New upstream version (4.0.0.8):
     - Use mktemp instead of tempfile (because Fedora does not have the tempfile
       binary). (Fixes: #347).
     - Replace makepasswd by pwgen (because Fedora does not have makepasswd).
     - Improve parsing of the NX session.log file where unexpected extra logging
       takes place during session suspension/resumption. Thanks to Gerald Richter
       for finding this!!! (Fixes: #356).
     - Avoid one argument system calls and backticks in x2gocleansessions and
       x2golistsessions_root.
     - Avoid one argument system calls and backticks in x2golistsessions.
     - Avoid one argument system calls and backticks in x2goprint.
     - Avoid backticks in x2goshowblocks, move script to &lt;prefix&gt;/sbin/ as it is
       for being run with root privileges.
     - Sanitize session ID string, port numbers, display numbers and agent PID
       numbers before writing them as strings to the session DB.
</PRE>
