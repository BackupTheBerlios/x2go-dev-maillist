     601_nx-X11_build-option-changes-to-not-use-bundled-libraries.full.patch.
     Improvements taken from the current Fedora package. Thanks to Orion
     Paplowski!!! Also adapt roll-tarball.sh do dropping more bundled
     libraries.
   * Rename patch: 302_nxagent_configurable-keystrokes.full.patch to
     320_nxagent_configurable-keystrokes.full.patch.
   * debian/source/format:
     + Switch to format 1.0.

     + Add libfreetype6-dev to Build-Depends: field.
     + Drop symlinking libNX_xrandr for setting a custom LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Not in
       use anymore and not recommended at all to have that.
     + Make sure all nx-libs components depend on the very same version.
   * debian/rules:

   * nx-libs.spec:
     + Ship nx-libs.spec (RPM package definitions) in upstream project. (Thanks

       already.
     + Clear (Fedora package) changelog.
     + Use local tarball, don't expect  ,,-full'' in tarball name.
     + The RPM macro for the linker flags does not exist on EPEL. Thus, hardcode
       __global_ldflags macro for EPEL builds.
     + Enable Xinerama support for RPM packages. (Fixes: #370).

     FTBFS of nx-libs-lite on Mac OS X Mavericks. (Fixes: #337).
