Hi you nice people who maintain X2go.

Sometimes a session is not ended cleanly and most of the time this does not matter everything is cleaned up and a new session can be started. However once in a while, one or more of the sshfs mounts to the local system remain active. This means that any subsequent attempt to logon fails, because it tries to mount and the mount already exists.

Maybe the solution is as simple as adding remount to the mount statement. (I don't know if this breaks the initial mount....)

Cheers,
Dick Kniep
