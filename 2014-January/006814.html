     - Add support for encrypted/locked/passphrase-protected SSH private key
       files.
     - Only show notifications if there really is something to show.
     - Support encrypted on SSH proxy whith password authentication on X2Go
       Server.
     - Implement two-factor authentication.
     - Don't crash if no notification-daemon provide is registered in DBUS.
       (Fixes: #321).
     - Become aware of new Python X2Go hook method
       (HOOK_on_failing_SFTP_client).
     - Become aware of new Python X2Go hook method (HOOK_desktop_sharing_denied).
     - Connect to sharable desktop session when selecting the session display
       with double click from the list of available desktop sessions.
     - Allow multiple PyHoca-GUI instances for the same user, one per $DISPLAY.
     - Allow for full path taskbar icon names, resolve tilde char in icon file
       path.
     - Allow for full path about image icon names, resolve tilde char in icon
       file path.
     - Resolve tilde char in file path of the about image.
     - Resolve tilde char in file path of the splash image.
     - Resolve tilde char in base directories for the PyHoca-GUI application.
     - Resolve tilde char in session icon names.
     - Fix termination of published application sessions.
     - Initialize thisPyHocaGUI instance as NoneType object before starting
       the wxApplication.
     - Slight notification layout change for HOOK_on_control_session_death() method.
     - Update German and English translation.
     - When installing icons via setup.py, let's use the copied icons rather than
       the icon set from icons_symlinked. That assures that really all icons are
       present. (The icons_symlinked folder is rather Debianic and not appropriate
       for non-Debian derived distributions).
   * debian/copyright:
     + Update file. Add entry for file icon2exe.py.
   * debian/control:
     + Recommend mate-notification-daemon (or notification-daemon as fallback).
   * debian/source/format:
     + Switch to format 1.0.
   * pyhoca-gui.spec:
     + Ship pyhoca-gui.spec (RPM package definitions) in upstream project.
       (Thanks to the Fedora package maintainers).
     + Add to BR: python-argparse, python-cups.
 .
