</I>We are building that scale of environment.  For better or worse, we have
been so overrun with consulting work that we are way behind where we
hoped to be in our X2Go build but we have taken a different approach.

We integrated X2Go and Linux-VServer.  Each user has a dedicated system
(great for things like non-repudiation) but the extra resource
requirements are minimal.  We then moved the x2gocleansession
processing to the VServer host so there is only one daemon running every
five seconds instead of hundreds.

We also adapted the database to use schemas - one per user, and triggers
for coordinating individual user changes with the master database used
by x2gocleansession and other reporting utilities we created.  Thus, we
have a single database for all those potentially hundreds of X2Go
servers.

Finally, we adapted the x2go printing so that we could use a single CUPS
server for all X2Go users and not have hundreds of instances of CUPS
running.

So far it has scaled very nicely but I am way behind in seeing how we
would make the same changes to 3.99 - John
