&gt;<i> Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it was reported on the list a while ago that somebody was having an issue where the mouse pointer within the X2GO session would disappear.  Well, I finally managed to get the same thing to happen to me this morning while running X2GO under Windows XP Pro.  Even suspending the session and re-connecting does not resolve the problem.  The issue appears to be the version of Xming that is being distributed with X2GO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why do I think this ? I suspended my session again and then killed of Xming via task manager.  This caused the X2GO plugin to fail for which I created a new FF tab and reconnected. I connected straight back to the same session and X instance as before and my mouse pointer was back in the land of the living.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The question is though how can we resolve this problem ? The 6.9 version of Xming that is shipped with X2GO is ~3 years out of date now, and to get the new 7.5 branch one has to subscribe.  Hmmm, this would be fine for a couple of users but when we may be handling 100,000 of them it would get a bit pricey :(
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts on what can be done ?
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
Xming has a site license for v7.5 available for &#163; 250 (125 academic).  
Unlimited users.  So that would not be all that expensive.  The other 
option is to find the source code for v6.9 and then we debug the 
vanishing mouse problem and create a patch.

Regards,
Gerry
