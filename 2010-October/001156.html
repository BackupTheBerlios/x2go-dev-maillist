That's interesting.  I was not aware that's how you bundled the Windows
XServer.  As someone who used both 3.01-2 and 3.01-4, the performance
improvement in 3.01-4 was astounding.  At least in our environment,
3.01-2 was almost unusable - very, very slow.  3.01-4 was just as fast
as using a Linux client.  I definitely do not want to step backwards in
terms of performance.

The bug is maddeningly random.  It seems to be provoked by some
applications more than others.  We have users who lose the mouse between
two and four times every day. Those users make heavy use of rdesktop.
We were not initially able to reproduce the error.  We finally did by
just letting it sit and having the screen saver kick (we start
automatically at five minutes and lock after one).  That does not always
provoke the error but it does occasionally.

Right now, we are testing replacing the provided xming with the website
paid version to see if the problem goes away.  Thanks - John
