</I>&gt;<i> fdcopy's.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> x2gopgwrapper as root. I checked out that script and the three scripts

</I>&gt;<i> the _net script I see no reason why root access is required. All these
</I>&gt;<i> scripts do is access a database and run queries. The _net script as
</I>&gt;<i> written probably needs root access, but there's no reason why with
</I>&gt;<i> some permission adjustments on the postgres database server that it
</I>&gt;<i> can't run unprivileged as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I'm just using sqlite on a single system, I did a little experiment
</I>&gt;<i> and made some changes to run that script as an unprivileged user.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I created an unprivileged x2go user with no password:  (The defaults
</I>&gt;<i> with this particular invocation of useradd are adequate, but the
</I>&gt;<i> account can be restricted some more)
</I>&gt;<i> useradd -r x2go
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So the sudoers entry becomes:
</I>&gt;<i> #### X2GO section
</I>&gt;<i> %x2gousers ALL=(x2go) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/x2gopgwrapper
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then permissions on the sqlite database need changing so our x2go user
</I>&gt;<i> can run its queries:
</I>&gt;<i> cd /var/db
</I>&gt;<i> sudo chown -R x2go.x2go x2go
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, the scripts in /usr/bin need to be changed so that
</I>&gt;<i> x2gopgwrapper runs at x2go:
</I>&gt;<i> for i in x2go*; do sed -ibak -e 's/sudo x2gopgwrapper/sudo -u x2go
</I>&gt;<i> x2gopgwrapper/' $i; done
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I made these changes on my system and have not had any issues
</I>&gt;<i> connecting. I am only using the x2goserver package at the moment; it's
</I>&gt;<i> just this one script that gets executed as root, I don't know about
</I>&gt;<i> any of the other packages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's also the matter of the x2gocleansessions cleanup script...
</I>&gt;<i> There's a couple of sudo calls in there as well, I didn't change that
</I>&gt;<i> just yet as I've just disabled it altogether to prevent the spam it
</I>&gt;<i> sends to my syslog.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I apologize if this topic has been brought up before or is discussed
</I>&gt;<i> in the documentation someplace; I looked around and didn't see
</I>&gt;<i> anything. I simply bring this up in the interest of system security.
</I>&gt;<i> The fewer things that run as root the better.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The changes I describe above are my quick hack-n-fix. If I get a
</I>&gt;<i> chance in the next few days I can throw together a proper fix and
</I>&gt;<i> submit a patch. (And please add my vote to the yes-please git
</I>&gt;<i> repository crowd.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> X2go seems to have a lot of possibilities and potential. Thanks to
</I>&gt;<i> Heinz and Alex for their hard work.

Hi, Rob.  I'm on a getaway with the family and &quot;sneaking&quot; this in so I
may be remembering the details incorrectly :)

You may want to trace all the other scripts which are invoked as part of
the process, especially x2gomount_sessions and x2goumount_sessions.
These may need root access - I'm not sure - John
