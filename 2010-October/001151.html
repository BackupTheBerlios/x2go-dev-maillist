<PRE>Hello all,

it was reported on the list a while ago that somebody was having an issue where the mouse pointer within the X2GO session would disappear.  Well, I finally managed to get the same thing to happen to me this morning while running X2GO under Windows XP Pro.  Even suspending the session and re-connecting does not resolve the problem.  The issue appears to be the version of Xming that is being distributed with X2GO.

Why do I think this ? I suspended my session again and then killed of Xming via task manager.  This caused the X2GO plugin to fail for which I created a new FF tab and reconnected. I connected straight back to the same session and X instance as before and my mouse pointer was back in the land of the living.

The question is though how can we resolve this problem ? The 6.9 version of Xming that is shipped with X2GO is ~3 years out of date now, and to get the new 7.5 branch one has to subscribe.  Hmmm, this would be fine for a couple of users but when we may be handling 100,000 of them it would get a bit pricey :(

Any thoughts on what can be done ?
