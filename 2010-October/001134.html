<PRE>I just read about this.

Google has introduced and open sourced  a new image format to help speed up
the performance of websites called W*ebP*.

   - *WebP has a 40% improvement over JPEG and WebP was designed to improve
   the compression offered by JPEG*.
   - Google has created a
site&lt;<A HREF="http://code.google.com/speed/webp/gallery.html">http://code.google.com/speed/webp/gallery.html</A>&gt;for Web developers
and users to assess the performance of WebP.
   - The images presented at the site show WebP side-by-side with JPEG
      images. The WebP images are 40 to 50 percent trimmer in bytes
but look the
      same to the human eye.
      - *WebP is based on Google's VP8 codec that they also open-sourced
      recently.  * VP8 is part of the heart of HTML 5's video capability.
      - To trim down file size for WebP, Google used an image compressor
      based on the VP8 codec that Google open-sourced in May 2010.

My question for x2go developers is

                             Could WebP (or VP8 codec itself) be implemented
at both the x2go-server and the x2go-client and *possibly get a substantial
improvement* in video performance ??

Currently x2go as most NX oriented solutions (Freenx, NoMachine NX)
typically use JPEG for compression.

But it seems to me that WebP could be implemented and as it is reported to
be 40% more efficient than JPEG...

                            less bytes means less network traffic and
usually better/faster performance.
