<PRE>Listen, man, I totally get everything you're saying. I know that it's all done for free with your own time and I get why open source developers accept donations. Again, I appreciate everything you've done. That being said, you have to imagine that it's frustrating to see a bug like this ignored for six months while dozens of other, arguably less visible bugs are fixed. If I was well versed in the language or framework used for this program, I might have pitched in already.  As I said, I'm a developer too, but I wouldn't ask someone to pay me a bounty for something like this because it's something rather basic that should have been caught in the first round of testing by whoever compiled the Mac version, which indicates to me that no testing was done beyond a single connection attempt. To say that there are too few Mac users who are annoyed by this just means that Mac users are not just low priority, but actually zero priority, because every single Mac user will encounter this bug upon performing this routine task just one time. Logging in and logging out is the most basic of elements of pretty much everything we do on a daily basis, but you seem to be fighting the idea of fixing this tooth-and-nail because you didn't like that I had to comment several times before anyone took notice. Now tell me, is that the kind of project you would want to donate to?

I never wanted to have an argument about this. All I did was contribute to a bug report many months ago and I thought someone would take it seriously since I wasn't the only one reporting it. If I had know this was one of those outfits where bug reports don't matter, even when someone else marks it as critical, I never would have bothered.

To me, that seems like something worth fixing without having to coerce
your individual, non-enterprise users to pay a bounty for properly
functioning interface.

Again, it's matter of motivation. Unfortunately there are too few Mac
users who are annoyed by this.... And I can totally not understand why
someone should spend his free time, while others are not willing to put
out a bounty (or spend their free time to make some money and then
donate that money)..... Like coding for an OSS is not as worthy as
coding for some other, commercial project.
