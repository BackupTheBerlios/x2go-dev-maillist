     - Update Danish translation file.
 .
   [ Terje Andersen ]

 .
   [ Oleksandr Shneyder ]
   * New upstream version (4.0.1.1):
     - Use &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; instead of localhost to avoid wrong IPv6 hostname
       resolution. (Fixes: #151).
     - Wait for x2gocmdexitmessage to return before closing in hidden mode.
     - Support for published applications in X2Go Plugin
     - Support for &quot;shadow&quot; mode in X2Go Plugin
 .
   [ Mike Gabriel ]
   * New upstream version (4.0.1.1):
     - If a priv SSH key has been specified, skip the autologin procedure.
       Let's consider a given SSH private key that fails to log the user
       in as an overall login failure. (Fixes: #141).
     - Avoid multiple selectUserSession requests when in broker
       mode.
     - Properly set the remote server address received via selectUserSession
       method when in broker mode. (Fixes: #226).
     - Fix segmentation fault that started occurring since the custom trayIcon
       patch was applied. Segfault only occurred if the tray icon was not used.
     - Show session name in notification bubbles.
     - Update German translation.
     - Add cmdline option --broker-autologoff: Enforce re-authentication against
       X2Go Session Broker after a session has been suspended or terminated.
       (Fixes: #179).
     - Enable full access desktop sharing across user accounts. (Fixes: #222).
     - Make X2Go Client aware of the MATE desktop environment.
     - Make X2Go Client work in SSH broker mode without the need of a auth-id
       file.
 .
   [ Heinrich Schuchardt ]
   * New upstream version (4.0.1.1):
     - Call ssh_clean_pubkey_hash() for deallocating public key hashes instead of
       just calling free(). Required under MS Windows as documented in libssh2
       API. (Fixes: #243). (For further details see:
       <A HREF="http://api.libssh.org/master/group__libssh__session.html">http://api.libssh.org/master/group__libssh__session.html</A>).
   * Provide bin:package with debug symbols for X2Go Client. (Fixes: #255).
 .
   [ Ezra B&#252;hler ]
   * New upstream version (4.0.1.1):
     - Fix auto-resume when session type is &#187;Single Application&#171;. (Fixes: #183).
 .
   [ Ricardo D&#237;az Mart&#237;n ]
   * New upstream version (4.0.1.1):
     - Fix detection of maximum screen area available for a session. (Fixes:
       #165).
     - Use the session icon as tray icon, pop up notification bubble that informs
       about current session actions. (Fixes: #177).
     - Allow for setting maximum available desktop size as window size via the
       session profile card. Unfortunately, this feature is for now only
       available on Linux. (Fixes: #214).
 .
   [ Otto Kjell ]
   * New upstream version (4.0.1.1):
     - Enable debug mode through cmd line parameter. (Fixes: #142).
     - Standardize output to stdout+stderr and make it parseable.
 .
   [ Orion Poplawski ]
   * New upstream version (4.0.1.1):
     - Instead of using a hard-code DPI of 96, use local DPI settings for new
       sessions if not explicitly set in session profile (Fixes: #164).
 .
   [ Daniel Lindgren ]
   * New upstream version (4.0.1.1):
