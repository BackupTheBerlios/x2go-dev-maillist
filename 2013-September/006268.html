Having to install an add-on tool doesn't qualify as &quot;any of the usual 
methods&quot;, IMHO.

&gt;<i> I agree that this is a _workaround_ (as we still don't have the thing

I am kind of surprised (in a negative way) and disappointed that there 
seems to be no native way of sending an equivalent of Alt+Spacebar to 
the Window. Because once you are able to *click* on the icon in the 
upper left corner of the window, you can go on just like with any 
regular Microsoft Windows window: Push ArrowDown until you're at the 
&quot;Move&quot; item, hit enter, move window with arrow keys, hit Enter again to 
position it there.
Makes me wonder if I'm just too stupid to find the proper key 
combination or if there's a bug blocking that Alt+Spacebar keycode 
(since after &quot;emulating&quot; that with a mouse click, it works &quot;the windows 
way&quot;, so it's not like the entire functionality is missing).
