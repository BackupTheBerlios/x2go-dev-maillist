<PRE>Hi Christopher, Morty,

please put down the ,,weapons'' guys!!!

Sometimes free software has peculiar workflows that may appear highly  
low-professional perceived throuth the business eye.  Many people are  
contributing in a several ways to X2Go, but at the moment, most of the  
tasks are routed through me. This is a little bit inefficient. For me,  
X2Go hacking is a lot about pleasure, so the development of X2Go tends  
to be dictate by joy and fun (not by demands of others).

For the last months, X2Go has been lacking man power, as well as  
financial focus. If you look at the commits on <A HREF="http://git.x2go.org,">http://git.x2go.org,</A>  
you will be able to see that almost the only person contributing to  
the X2Go code is me. And those commits are dictated by the use cases I  
have for X2Go. If others have other use cases, then please step in and  
either contract me (or anyone else who is able to work on the code) or  
provide code your self.

With me and Mac OS X the problem is: I do not use a Mac and I don't  
have one. I can access one via VNC, but fixing keyboard problems with  
a VNC connection (that is buggy on keyboard mappings anyway) feels not  
like a delightful task.


For those, you are not familiar with X2Go coding, here are many other  
todos around X2Go where people can jump in:

  o Help getting X2Go into as many Linux distros as possible
  o Conceptual work on crowd-funding
  o Improve documentation (wiki)
  o Provide screenshot serieses
  o Provide physical Mac OS hardware for the developers (i.e. me)
  o Contract me for getting bugs fixed
  o Send patches
  o Join any of the packaging teams (Linux, Mac)
  o Take over the MS Windows builds of X2Go Client
  o Join the i18n team and translate X2Go into your language
  o Provide a teaser www page for www.x2go.org (e.g. like [1])
  o Provide howtos for special setups
  o Provide a getting started page for the wiki ([2]) (Markus: you wanted to do
    this!!! What happened???)
  o Let us know your success story with X2Go [3]
  o Test several different setups and ask questions -&gt; condense our answers
    into new special case documentation
  o ...

Greets,
Mike
