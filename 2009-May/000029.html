<PRE>Hello list, I appologize ahead of time if this has already been brought up, but
I couldn't find anything about this yet.

I recently set up x2go in a xen guest, and when I try to connect to it with the
gtk client, the keyboard isn't right. Everything seems to work, except the arrow
keys. If I turn numlock on/off, then the arrows on the keypad seem to work, but
not the normal arrow keys. I've tried everything I can think of to set the keyboard
both on the client and on the actual host. Everything is set to 105key qwerty US,
but the arrow keys still don't work.

The maemo client using the directional pad seemed to work fine simulating the arrow
keys, so I'm not sure if it would work with the QT client or not as I haven't tried
that client yet.

Anyone else run into this issue yet? It may very well be due to the machine running
under xen, so I'm not sure if anyone else is doing something similar or not.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Doug
