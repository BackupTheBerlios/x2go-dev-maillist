</I>Hmm . . . our problem has magically gone away :-(  At first I thought it
was because we use a non-standard SSH port for security.  We changed the
SSH port expected for local shares in the X2GoClient to reflect the
changed port (options settings).  The local shares worked fine but
printing did not.  We noticed errors about transport not connected (I
believe this is a fuse error) and saw that the file permissions in
the /tmp/spooler directory were mangled (mostly question marks).

We changed back to the standard port 22 and printing jumped alive.  We
changed back to the non-standard port to confirm this was the problem
and, lo and behold, printing still worked! We switched a few times,
restarted the host.  Printing still works.  I have no idea what
changed :-(
