&gt;<i> Dear x2go users,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> for the last months we've been working on a new release. First we 
</I>&gt;<i> thought to bring some new features, but now we'll bundle it, because 
</I>&gt;<i> there where many changes needed.
</I>&gt;<i> It still will take some time to the release, but we wan't to inform you 
</I>&gt;<i> on some changes we are discussing.
</I>&gt;<i> First of all: We are planing a multi session x2goclient for the release 
</I>&gt;<i> after the next release. So there will be a lot of work of redesigning 
</I>&gt;<i> our clients. This would be easier with only one client architecture and 
</I>&gt;<i> as the Qt client is our base for the Linux, Windows, Maemo and Mac OSX 
</I>&gt;<i> platforms, we are asking the question:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would it be ok to focus our work on the Qt client and to stop/reduce our 
</I>&gt;<i> work on the GTK client?
</I>
Yes. I understand it's much work to work on two clients.

( But for the longer future I would advice to take a look at WxWidgeds.
When you use that, you don't need to add a toolkit, because the original
toolkit of the platform is used. )

&gt;<i> Yes, there will be a Browser Plugin. It will be realized  as a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;sponsored development&quot; so we'll get some money for our work and the 
</I>&gt;<i> sponsor will be named.
</I>&gt;<i> You'll be able to integrate the plugin into a Website and you'll have 
</I>&gt;<i> all features of the x2goclient.
</I>
Nice to hear!

&gt;<i> Yes there will be a &quot;session sharing&quot; option without the need of a LDAP 
</I>&gt;<i> server. The new &quot;session sharing&quot; option will make it possible to share 
</I>&gt;<i> a x2go session with another user, to share a already started xorg 
</I>&gt;<i> session with another user and to share a session with more than one 
</I>&gt;<i> user. There will be a system tray application which will help 
</I>&gt;<i> configuring the sharing settings.
</I>
Really great ;-)

&gt;<i> After getting so many mails about a wiki for documentation - yes we are 
</I>&gt;<i> working on a wiki which will replace the odf/pdf/html manuals.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are looking for new localisations. If x2goclient is not available in 
</I>&gt;<i> your language and you want to translate it, please let us know (on the 
</I>&gt;<i> list ). We'll provide a *.ts file for your language (qt-linguist).
</I>
I did this already for the Dutch language. The Dutch translation is in
the GTK version, but not in the QT version. Are there problems with the
translation?

&gt;<i> We'll announce the the release here on the list and on our blog - at the 
</I>&gt;<i> moment we can't tell you when it'll be ready. So please stay tuned and 
</I>&gt;<i> tell us what you think about the news...
</I>
Success with the good work...

Met vriendelijke groet,
Paul van der Vlis.
