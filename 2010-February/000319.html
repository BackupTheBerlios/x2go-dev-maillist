Interesting.  I was working on this last night and that's where I left
off - the job printed from the application but there was no output and
print manager had no jobs in queue.  We are also using LDAP based users.
I assumed it was my misconfiguration and plan to pick this up again in
an hour or two so I will be very interested in other responses to this
issue.

I was wondering if I misunderstood the documentation and I misconfigured
the group memberships.  It says, &quot;If you would like to use the file
system sharing option of X2go, you'll need to make sure that those users
also are part of the posix group &#8220;fuse&#8221;. This membership is also needed
by x2goprint.&quot;  I assumed that means the x2goprint user must be a member
of fuse.  Is that the case or is it really saying the user must be a
member of x2goprint? Thanks - John
