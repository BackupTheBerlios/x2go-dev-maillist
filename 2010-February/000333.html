No need to reply -- just reporting in our results especially since this
is unsupported Hardy.  We will be testing Lenny shortly.

Funnily, when I told the icons on my desktop to reorganize, the ugly
artifacts turned into device icons but they were all mounted and they
could not unmount.  I reconfigured the VServer running X2Go so tmp was
now exec,suid,dev.  This changed nothing.  The devices could neither
mount nor unmount.  The devices seem to be automounted when I shared
them from the X2Go Client.

I also noticed that sshfs is a little more hit and miss than I'd like
for production.  When we start a fresh session, sometimes we can share
local media and sometimes we cannot.  We get errors such as:

sshd[9540]: error: channel_setup_fwd_listener: cannot listen to port:
30002

Again, no need to fret unless this persists on Lenny.  Thanks - John
