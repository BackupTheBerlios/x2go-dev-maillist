<PRE>Dear x2go users,

for the last months we've been working on a new release. First we 
thought to bring some new features, but now we'll bundle it, because 
there where many changes needed.
It still will take some time to the release, but we wan't to inform you 
on some changes we are discussing.
First of all: We are planing a multi session x2goclient for the release 
after the next release. So there will be a lot of work of redesigning 
our clients. This would be easier with only one client architecture and 
as the Qt client is our base for the Linux, Windows, Maemo and Mac OSX 
platforms, we are asking the question:

Would it be ok to focus our work on the Qt client and to stop/reduce our 
work on the GTK client?

If we would go on developing both clients equally, it will really take a 
long time to implement all new planned features and this will slow down 
the whole project. The Question can also be transformed: Is there 
anybody interested to help us to keep the GTK client up to date?

Please tell us your thoughts but keep in mind, that the Qt Toolkit is 
available on all major distros and we'll keep on developing our Gnome 
bindings. This will not be a preconfigured &quot;choice of Desktop Environment&quot;.

So we think we should now continue with some of the new features of the 
next release (as a contrast):

Yes, there will be a Browser Plugin. It will be realized  as a 
&quot;sponsored development&quot; so we'll get some money for our work and the 
sponsor will be named.
You'll be able to integrate the plugin into a Website and you'll have 
all features of the x2goclient.

Yes there will be a &quot;session sharing&quot; option without the need of a LDAP 
server. The new &quot;session sharing&quot; option will make it possible to share 
a x2go session with another user, to share a already started xorg 
session with another user and to share a session with more than one 
user. There will be a system tray application which will help 
configuring the sharing settings.

After getting so many mails about a wiki for documentation - yes we are 
working on a wiki which will replace the odf/pdf/html manuals.

We are looking for new localisations. If x2goclient is not available in 
your language and you want to translate it, please let us know (on the 
list ). We'll provide a *.ts file for your language (qt-linguist).

We'll announce the the release here on the list and on our blog - at the 
moment we can't tell you when it'll be ready. So please stay tuned and 
tell us what you think about the news...

best regards,

Heinz and Alex
