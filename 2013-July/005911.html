</I>
It isn't like that at all, X11 clients and servers have to comply with
the respective parts of the protocol. If the protocol demands insecure
behaviour, its a design bug, or maybe, like in this case, a compromise
nobody likes: Since in X11 clients handle all the shortcuts and mouse
button events, since clients or toolkits handle the widgets, the only
option to implement C&amp;P is to have clients ask the server for the
clipboard or selection contents. Its more a &quot;there is no other way to do
it except to make it unusable&quot; kind of problem imho.

&gt;<i> 2) Literally no one who has a decent mind of security, will allow other
</I>&gt;<i> hosts do directly access their X server.. because then you're (security
</I>&gt;<i> wise) anyway screwed...
</I>
I'm not only talking about 'xhost +' and the like, this would of course
be a major problem for more reasons than only the clipboard. And if you
wouldn't trust a host with 'ssh -X', then you also shouldn't trust it
with x2go. Just think of x2go as a variant of 'ssh -X' with image
compression and some extras. X11 protocol firewalling is not really one
of those extras. And since the x2goclient will always run in your local
X session, it will always be able to read your clipboard.

&gt;<i> And I thought NX would secure what's sent from remote in order to not
</I>&gt;<i> being able to overtake the input/output devices of the hosts (whole)
</I>&gt;<i> Xserver).
</I>
In a way, yes. Afaik you can avoid certain attacks of the &quot;I'll attach
to the root window and get all key events&quot; kind since windowed x2go
sessions give you a separate root window. But I imagine there are more
problems out there nobody thought of yet.



Ciao,
