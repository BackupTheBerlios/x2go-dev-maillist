</I>To be honest, I think both are strong reasons for expecting this... as
well as one easily tend to compare it with VNC (which gives you rather
the &quot;secure&quot; screenshots)...
But moreover... it's nowwhere really documented (at least where people
easily see it) - I didn't find it at all.
When one goes into the ssh/ssh_config manpages and read about the X
forwarding options... strongly warns one about the security implications
(which are basically like giving root to the remote).
When one reads the xauth manpage (and the fact that there is a dedicated
program which one needs to grant privileges)... one reads about what one
does.

With X2go/NX.. there seem to be no such emphasised warnings in the
obvious places.


&gt;<i> After all, I think that it's not a grave issue as most people use X11
</I>&gt;<i> forwarding for rather trusted hosts (or just don't care).
</I>Well... don't think so... even not for the trusted ones (not to talk
about untrusted hosts)... but this is probably since people have
different requirements on security.


&gt;<i> One additional note: it's possible to turn on clipboard forwarding in
</I>&gt;<i> RDP and VNC (and it's a very useful thing) but AFAIR in most clients
</I>&gt;<i> _one have to specify it implicitly_ (and sometimes there's a separate
</I>&gt;<i> option that allows some restricted clipboard access, for example
</I>Yes... it is... but there you have to at least enable it (even though
most programs miss a strong warning on what can then easily happen...)


But to be honest... the clipboard sniffing problem seems to be &quot;boring&quot;
compared with the &quot;direct interaction&quot; with my local x server... at
least with respect to my security thinking...


Oh and no one from the developers should get me wrong:
I do see that NX is very nice and great with respect to it's speed,
which is probably not doable with VNC like screenshoting.... but a) I
think people are not warned/told enough about what happens
(technically)... and b) clear information misses... on what could
actually happen (in the sense of &quot;is it secure as it is, or can this
direct communication with the local X server cause troubles - perhaps
there are none... and they only issues where those with the global root
window.. which seems not possible with NX? But perhaps there are!).


Cheers,
Chris.
