</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can confirm the significant improvement in performance.  For example,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and what really made me think Nagle, my ping results display much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; better.  When doing ping tests previously, the results would stutter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even though the response times were nearly even.  In fact, sometimes I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would seem to miss a packet only to have two display the next second.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; They are now perfectly smooth.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, we still have a BIG problem.  X2Go client printing still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; segfaults the entire client every single time we try to print.  Phil has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; confirmed this independently from me.  Any ETA on that fix? Thanks -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; John
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Mike, have we had a regression in the heuler code to reintroduce this
</I>&gt;<i> problem? I'm noticing similar behavior.  I thought is was an Internet
</I>&gt;<i> connectivity issue on my part as we were having issues but we spent
</I>&gt;<i> hours today confirming that the circuits had been repaired and Internet
</I>&gt;<i> performance is better than ever here in the test lab but we are still
</I>&gt;<i> seeing the delayed screen painting.  The client is 3.99.0.2.  Thanks -
</I>&gt;<i> John
</I>I can confirm this again today - that annoying phenomenon that provokes
constant typing errors when the last key (e.g., backspace or delete) is
pressed and there is a several second delay before the effect is seen
even on a blazing fast connection.

In fact, I wonder if this is causing the Firefox problem.  As we
reported earlier, only when using then newer versions of X2Go client, we
have problems where Firefox hangs for roughly 16 seconds.  All other
applications are functioning and it is not a Firefox issue; it is a
screen updating issue.  Hmm . . . I suppose that means it would not be
Nagle as other applications are working properly.  Oh well but, as an
aside, we would consider the Firefox problem to be another critical
error blocking production release.  Thanks - John
