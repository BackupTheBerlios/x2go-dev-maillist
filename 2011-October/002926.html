Hi, Morty.  Thanks for asking.  No, it is presented as local storage
but it is pulling across an iSCSI connection.  The problem is greatly
exacerbated in the libssh versions.  The older X2Go version gave about a
3 second delay which was annoying.  The newer versions give a 16-20
second delay which is just about unusable.  As reported earlier, we
notice it most with AJAX intensive sites - John
