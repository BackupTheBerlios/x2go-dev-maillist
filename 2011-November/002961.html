<PRE>Hello Jean,

hello and welcome to our dvelopment list. Thank you for joining as this
is the best way to get in contact. Mike has answered a lot of questions
before - thank you Mike.

There are a lot of ideas about what problem x2go should solve. As
mentioned by Mike before, not all ideas become part of the mainstream
distribution, but are very interesting for the people too. So maybe it
is a good idea to share your ideas and needs with the people on this
list, maybe there are already some solutions or you can share your work
with others. Of cause it would be very nice to have code and ideas
contributed which can be part of a future mainstream release.

I want to add, that the parts we have contributed will become AGPL
licensed with the next release.

If you encounter problems using our wiki, please let me know, because we
are migrating sites to a new structure and are not ready yet. If you are
looking for a page that can't be found, please visit this site:

<A HREF="http://wiki.x2go.org/link-orphans">http://wiki.x2go.org/link-orphans</A>

I really hope that our answers cover your questions. If not, please feel
free to ask further questions.

Regards,

Heinz

Hi Mike,

should we copy those lines you've written about how to join the team to
a special wiki page?

&gt;<i> Of course, there is an apprenticeship for becoming an X2Go developer:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   o get a wiki account, while discovering X2Go, become aware of lacking
</I>&gt;<i>     documentation, doc-bugs, etc. -&gt; help us fixing those
</I>&gt;<i>   o checkout the development section on this page:
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://wiki.x2go.org/wiki:index#development">http://wiki.x2go.org/wiki:index#development</A>
</I>&gt;<i>   o make sure that you know how to use Git (VCS software), if you have
</I>&gt;<i> questions
</I>&gt;<i>     contact me (Mike) on this list, Reinhard and Morty are also very
</I>&gt;<i> familiar
</I>&gt;<i>     with Git issues
</I>&gt;<i>   o set up your local development workspace:
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://wiki.x2go.org/wiki:development-workspace">http://wiki.x2go.org/wiki:development-workspace</A>
</I>&gt;<i>   o make sure you understand the code structure and the session
</I>&gt;<i> ,,handshake'',
</I>&gt;<i>     study the code!!!
</I>&gt;<i>   o whenever you find a bug, an improvement, try to fix it, try to
</I>&gt;<i> implement it.
</I>&gt;<i>     what you come up with -&gt; send it as a patch to the x2go-dev list for
</I>&gt;<i>     reviewing
</I>&gt;<i>   o if your patches and ideas prove to be generic and community suitable
</I>&gt;<i> (we
</I>&gt;<i>     cannot serve special use cases in X2Go upstream(!!!), the community
</I>&gt;<i> version
</I>&gt;<i>     of X2Go aims to be generic and adaptable to local setups), then you
</I>&gt;<i> may get
</I>&gt;<i>     write access to the code repository some time in the future

Regards,

Heinz
