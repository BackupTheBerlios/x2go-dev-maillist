<PRE>Hi List,

I'd like to suggest two changes to the X2go Windows client, though they 
might make sense for the MacOS X and Linux Clients (when used on a &quot;fat&quot; 
Linux client) as well:

1) UI change:
When the x2go-client is *not* used in thin-client mode, the session 
selection screen should not fill the entire screen. It should be the 
size of a single session item, like in the vertical bar on the right, or 
similar in size to the Nomachine NX client login screen.

I fully understand that you need a screen-filling display mode when 
running on a thin client, so maybe there should be a command line option 
to select which UI mode is needed, and make the smaller one the default 
on Windows (and possibly Mac OS X as well) at compile-time.

2) Behavioral change:
When a session is active, the Windows 7 task bar shows two windows: The 
remote desktop/application, as well as the session selection screen.
In my opinion, the session selection screen should be hidden when a 
successful connection has been established. It should only pop up again 
if the session was terminated due to an error (application crash, loss 
of network connection, etc.). Again, this is similar to how NoMachine NX 
clients handle this.

Just my 0,015 EUR.

Kind Regards,
Stefan
