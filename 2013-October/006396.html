<PRE>Hi Mike, this fix to authenticate the commands is good. I didn't realize 
I was uncovering a security problem.

One question: the underlying crash was due to bad data. If authenticated 
but still bad data is sent, will the client still crash? I am thinking 
about a malicious server crafting something to crash the client or have 
it do something bad. I looked at the code diff and I didn't see some 
underlying verification of the x2go commands.

E.g.:
X2GODATABEGIN:&lt;good-uuidhash&gt;
bad data here
X2GODATAEND:&lt;good-uuidhash&gt;
