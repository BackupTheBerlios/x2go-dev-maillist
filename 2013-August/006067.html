<PRE>Package: x2goclient
Version: 4.0.1.0
Severity: grave

The following problem persists at least in the mac version, but can be also found in the linux version:

1) Start a remote session.
2) click on the pause button in the session view
3) You will see the login screen for the connection, asking for username and password.

The focus seems to be on the password field. But if you type something, nothing appears inside password or username field, so the focus lies somewhere else.

4) Try to move the focus to the password field by pressing tab or clicking. Nothing happens. (Note: In the linux version, I was eventually able to put the focus back to the password field when pressing tab.)

Only solution to resume the session is to restart the x2goclient, and then log in again.
