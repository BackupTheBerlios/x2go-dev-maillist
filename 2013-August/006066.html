X2Go Component: src:python-x2go
Version: 0.4.0.7
Status: RELEASE
Date: Sat, 03 Aug 2013 22:28:13 +0200
Fixes: 283
Changes: 
 python-x2go (0.4.0.7) RELEASED; urgency=low
 .
   [ Mike Gabriel ]
   * New upstream version (0.4.0.7):
     - Drop duplicate method in terminal backend: is_desktop_session().
     - Ignore non-registered session UUIDs in X2GoClient.clean_sessions() method.
     - Make _update_mounts in session registry cache more failsafe, this probably
       fixes an accumulation of server disconnects observed in recent version of
       Python X2Go.
     - Add some sanity checks before actually starting to add a session profile.
   * /debian/control:
     + Replace LDAP support with session brokerage support in LONG_DESCRIPTION.
 .
   [ Orion Poplawski ]
   * New upstream version (0.4.0.7):
     - Remove shbangs from python-x2go library code. (Fixes: #283).
