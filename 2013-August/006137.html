<PRE>HI Orion,

I re-include x2go-dev, I hope that's ok.

&gt;<i> So:

</I>&gt;<i> - Why split out -compat?  Doesn't seem to add any dependencies.
</I>
Not necessarily needed. /me thinks about removing the compat commands  
completely, as they have been obsolete for more then 3 years now.

&gt;<i> - Why split out -extensions?  Okay, does pull x11-xkb-utils which  
</I>&gt;<i> isn't otherwise required, but it appears to be recommended that you  
</I>&gt;<i> have it.  rpm doesn't have the concept of &quot;Recommends&quot; or  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Suggests&quot;, just hard dependencies.
</I>
In some setups, the site admin may decide to leave it uninstalled. (Or  
rather: to uninstall it after it got pulled in via Recommends: field  
in /debian/control).

Also, removing x2goserver-extensions may ease the X2Go Server  
debugging in some occasions.

&gt;<i> - Why split out -xsession?  Adds dep on x11-common which appears to  
</I>&gt;<i> not be otherwise required.  Only suggested.
</I>
The -xsession package is only necessary for people providing a full  
screen desktop shell. For people providing SaaS the -xsession package  
is not needed.

And x11-common is normally not needed for X2Go functionality. We hook  
into the system's Xsession scripts (via symlinking), so that's why we  
depend on x11-common here.

&gt;<i> - Why split out -fmbindings?  Adds deps on xdg-utils,  
</I>&gt;<i> desktop-file-utils (although for Fedora, this is not required, but  
</I>&gt;<i> xdg-utils requires it). Although it seems nearly impossible to  
</I>&gt;<i> install almost any desktop without xdg-utils (lxde and xfce seem to  
</I>&gt;<i> require it), and it is tiny and has few dependencies.
</I>
Instead of x2goserver-fmbindings people can use x2go*bindings. Also  
site admins may not want to add desktop icon support for locally  
shared folders.

&gt;<i> - Why split out -pyhoca?  Does not appear to add any dependencies.   
</I>&gt;<i> Doesn't appear to do anything as far as I can see.
</I>
The -pyhoca package is deprecated. It stems from a time when I was to  
shy to add functionalty to the x2goserver core package when I needed  
it for pyhoca-gui. This shyness is obviously gone...

I will remove the x2goserver-pyhoca package in some future release  
completely. So ignore it.

&gt;<i> I already split out -printing, although I'm not sure that added much  
</I>&gt;<i> (perl(File::Basename), perl(File::Copy)), so that might have been  
</I>&gt;<i> silly.  So, I guess I could see splitting out -xsession and possibly  
</I>&gt;<i> -fmbindings, but that's about it.
</I>
Splitting out printing is a must IMHO as it creates a separate  
user:group (x2goprint:x2goprint).

&gt;<i> Looking at dependencies:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - lsof - from x2goshowblocks:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> my @outp=dbsys_getmounts( $id);
</I>&gt;<i> for (my $i=0;$i&lt;@outp;$i++)
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>         my $path=(split(&quot;\|&quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">, at outp</A>[$i]))[1];
</I>&gt;<i>         print `su $uname -c &quot;lsof 2&gt;/dev/null | grep $path&quot;`;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, it's inefficient if there are more than one mount entries, but  
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise I don't see a better way of doing it off hand.  But this I  
</I>&gt;<i> could actually imagine going into a utils/debug package.  Unless it  
</I>&gt;<i> is used for something else?
</I>
Yeah. This can surely be improved.

&gt;<i> - bc - from x2goruncommand
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> echo &quot;$DISTRIB_RELEASE &gt;= 11.10&quot; | bc
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, not that much on my machine depends on bc.  Since  
</I>&gt;<i> x2goserver already depends on perl, I'd be tempted to use that  
</I>&gt;<i> instead:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> perl -e &quot;print $DISTRIB_RELEASE &gt;= 11.10&quot;
</I>
As the x2goruncommand should be turned into Perl at some time later, I  
will be happy to accept a tested patch for this.

Mike
