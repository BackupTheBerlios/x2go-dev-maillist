X2Go Component: src:nx-libs
Version: 2:3.5.0.21
Status: RELEASE
Date: Fri, 30 Aug 2013 16:18:04 +0200
Fixes: 199 223 238 293
Changes: 
 nx-libs (2:3.5.0.21-0) RELEASED; urgency=low
 .
   [ Mike Gabriel ]
   * Provide a default keystrokes.cfg in /etc/nx (for nxagent) and /etc/x2go
     (for x2goagent). (Fixes: #199).
   * Use a keystrokes.cfg that reflects the normally hard-coded defaults of
     a vanilla nxagent. (Fixes: #223).
   * Set NXAGENT_KEYSTROKEFILE to /etc/x2go/keystrokes.cfg for wrapper x2goagent.
   * For vanilla nxagent move keystrokes.cfg from /etc/nx to /etc/nxagent.
   * Tarball roller script:
     + Only install keystrokes.cfg when in full mode.
     + Only install nxproxy wrapper when in lite mode.
   * /debian/control:
     + Add B-Ds: libfontconfig1-dev, libfontenc-dev.
   * /debian/nx-libs-dev.install:
     + Remove unrelated files from -dev package.
   * Fix keystrokes.cfg, use Ctrl+Alt+&lt;key&gt; instead of just Ctrl+&lt;key&gt;. (Adds to
     fixing #223).
 .
   [ Orion Poplawski ]
   * Change build options so that bundled libraries are not used anymore at
     build time. Remove bundled libraries from rolled tarballs, as well. (Fixes:
     #238).
   * Add patch: 602_nx-X11_initgroups.full.patch. Fix calling setuid and setgid
     without setgroups or initgroups. There is a high probability this means it
     didn't relinquish all groups, and this would be a potential security issue
     to be fixed. Seek POS36-C on the web for details about the problem. (Fixes:
     #293).
