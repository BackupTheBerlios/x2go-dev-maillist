<PRE>Hi list,

I'd like to start a quick and informal poll:

 From what I can tell, Mac OS X 10.5 is no longer supported by Apple 
(i.e. no new security fixes will be provided etc.).

Miha is currently developing on Mac OS X 10.6, and cross-checking on my 
Mac Mini with Mac OS X 10.5 to see if everything works there, too.

At present, we do not seem to have anybody developing/checking on Mac OS 
10.7, which is the current Mac OS X release.

If we could agree on dropping support for 10.5, I would upgrade my Mac 
Mini to 10.7, or, should it turn out to be too slow for 10.7, we might 
arrange for Miha to upgrade his Mac to 10.7 and I'd upgrade to 10.6.

Of course, if the majority of our Mac users is still on 10.5, we'd shoot 
ourselves in the foot by dropping support for it.

So, please speak up and let us know which version you are using, and in 
what numbers (especially those of you offering commercial support to 
clients on Mac OS X)!

-Stefan
</PRE>
