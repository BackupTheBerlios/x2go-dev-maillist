And again, this can and should be solved by setting proper access rights 
in the file system.

&gt;<i> * what kind of bandwidth (LAN/WAN/ADSL/dialup)
</I>&gt;<i> * printing for certain user(s)/group(s)/server(s)
</I>&gt;<i> * clipboard - only at server or client
</I>&gt;<i> * use of shared folders (for the x2go session)
</I>

These config options would indeed be nice on the server side, though I 
don't see them as a high priority, except for maybe clipboard and shared 
folders (by the way, shared folders and printing require the user to be 
a member of the fuse group, so again this can be managed already using 
existing mechanisms, though limited in the form that you can only 
enable/disable both at once).
My preferred way of handling this would be using config files in a 
/etc/x2go/forcedconfig.d/ directory, where seperate files with either 
names or ownership/permissions matching the group/user you want to cover 
are stored.  That way, it's all in the file system, just like it's 
supposed to be. ;-)

Also, the client should notify the user if a forced setting overrules 
something in his local setting.  Otherwise, you're going to confuse the 
heck out of users and first level supporters when the settings don't match.

If you want to discuss this further, I'd suggest changing the title of 
the thread or creating a new one. :-)
