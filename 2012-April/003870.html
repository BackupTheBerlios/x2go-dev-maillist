It took me some time to realize how to use the new Published 
Applications feature as I didn't noticed the new button below the 
sessions connection information. In an email there was a reference to a 
menu in the systray, but I couldn't see any systray icon appear. When I 
finally discovered that little anonymous button I was happy, but I think 
I'm not alone in not immediately understand/see what that little button 
is for, or even that it's there.

Therefore I added a wiki entry for this here:
<A HREF="http://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/wiki:components:published-applications">http://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/wiki:components:published-applications</A>

This is an initial version, hopefully I will find time to expand it 
further to also include more detailed information targeting sys-admins.

One thing I couldn't get to work in the wiki was the uploaded 
screenshots, can someone please take a look at that page and see what I 
did wrong? I can see the images in the media manager, I can pick them 
when I click on the insert image icon in the wysiwyg toolbar, but still 
the final saved page doesn't display them...

Also, this feature is really great! I can see a lot of potential for 
this feature :-)

Thanks,
Terje
