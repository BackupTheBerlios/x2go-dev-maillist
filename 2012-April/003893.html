</I>Hi Morty and list,

My suggestion was about enforcing configuration, yes.

I'm sorry that I didn't explain my point good enough in my previous 
email, but if you look at the page I linked to, you will hopefully see 
the value in something like the (wrongfully named) nxacl.

<A HREF="http://openfacts2.berlios.de/wikien/index.php/BerliosProject:FreeNX_-_HowtoACL">http://openfacts2.berlios.de/wikien/index.php/BerliosProject:FreeNX_-_HowtoACL</A>

This is similar to what NoMachine calls User Profiles which consists of 
rules (in their terminology).
<A HREF="http://www.nomachine.com/documents/admin-guide.php">http://www.nomachine.com/documents/admin-guide.php</A>  (chapter 8)

In my view, being able to enforce or restrict
* what kind of session the user(s)/group(s) should be able to access/use
* what kind of bandwidth (LAN/WAN/ADSL/dialup)
* printing for certain user(s)/group(s)/server(s)
* clipboard - only at server or client
* use of shared folders (for the x2go session)
* + many more possibilities

... is valuable.

If it should be implemented, that's not for me to say (although I would 
love it if it was), it was a suggestion on how to solve this question:

&quot;2) Is the a way to configure x2oserver to accept only &quot;published
applications&quot; without any desktop environment ?&quot;

Best regards,
Terje
