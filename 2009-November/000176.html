<PRE>Hello X2Go friends,

Today, we have uploaded new X2go packages with a lot of changes:

Qt x2goclient 3.01-4

windows: <A HREF="http://prdownload.berlios.de/x2go/x2goclient-3.01-4-setup.exe">http://prdownload.berlios.de/x2go/x2goclient-3.01-4-setup.exe</A>
macos: <A HREF="http://prdownload.berlios.de/x2go/x2goclient-3.01-4.dmg.zip">http://prdownload.berlios.de/x2go/x2goclient-3.01-4.dmg.zip</A>
and linux(amd64,i386,ppc, and maemo)

Gtk x2goclient 3.01-7
nxcomp 3.4.0-1
nxcomext 3.4.0-1
nxcomshad 3.4.0-1
nxproxy 3.4.0-2
x2goagent 3.4.0-3
x2goserver 3.0.1-2
cups-x2go 3.0.0-1

The made changes:

x2goclient (both, Qt and Gtk):

1. Added a field in session preferences &quot;Set display DPI&quot; ( Paul, you
welcome  ;)   ).
You'll also need the latest x2goserver package to use this feature
2. You can use RSA/DSA keys with password protection now
3. Settings for PulseAudio clients will not be saved in ~/.pulse any
more, but in ~/.x2go/&lt;session dir&gt;. That will allow you to start on
x2goserver so many sessions with the same user account as you wish, and
to use PulseAudio with all of them simultaneously. Also your standard
PulseAudio client settings on server will not be lost any more.
4. The pulse-cookie will be copied from client machine to server. X2Go
client will check if PulseAudio is started in system mode or as a
per-session daemon (default and recommended). In first case
/var/run/pulse/.pulse-cookie will be copied, in second ~/.pulse-cookie
5. X2Go Client will try to load PulseAudio module
&quot;module-native-protocol-tcp&quot; automatically.
Changes 3,4,5 will allow you to use sound with PulseAudio without making
any configuration procedures on your server and client machines.
6. X2Go client will check if a local port for graphic tunnel is free,
and if this port is already used, it'll search for the next free port.
Now you will be able to start several X2Go sessions on different X2go
servers simultaneously even if the sessions are using the same port
for graphic
tunnel.
7. X2Go client will start ssh connection with option
&quot;ServerAliveInterval=300&quot;. That should solve problems with some routers
which interrupting the TCP connection after some time idling -&gt; in our
case the reverse ssh tunnel for sound and file sharing (also spool for
printing) (Tobias, please let me know if it solve your problem)
8. The default value for &quot;Keep current keyboard settings&quot; is set to
FALSE. The default keyboard layout will be taken from your
localization. (pc105/de for German, pc105/ru for Russian, etc)

Windows specific changes:

1. X2Go client setup program now contains an X-Server and PulseAudio
build from sources. The installer of Xming and PulseAudio build from
Cendio are no longer part of this package.
2. sshd will no longer be started as system daemon.
3. every X2Go client process will start a own version of X, ssh and
PulseAudio. This allows you to start as many x2goclient instances as
you wish.
4. For printing and viewing PDFs (X2goprint) it's now possible to use
the windows default PDF viewer application with winapi function
&quot;ShellExec&quot; (If you use this option you won't need ghostscript any
more). You can simply print with Acrobat Reader.

cups-x2go:
support for sqlite db on server

x2goserver:
1. Support for DPI settings in x2goclient
2. ssh option &quot;ServerAliveInterval=300&quot; in x2gomountdirs.
3. Support for limitation of user session, which are running
simultaneously.
To use this feature, you must edit file /etc/x2go/x2goserver.conf, which
normally look like this:

[limit users]
beispielb=1

[limit groups]
x2gousers=2

&lt;EOF&gt;

In this file you have two sections. In the section &quot;limit users&quot; you can
specify limits for specific users. In &quot;limit groups&quot;  you can do the
same for groups. &quot;limit users&quot; hase a higher priority then &quot;limit
groups&quot;.
For example:

[limit users]
beispielb=0

[limit groups]
x2gousers=1
teacher=3

The limit of &quot;beispielb&quot; will be &quot;0&quot; (unlimited)
independent from groups settings. If there is no entry for the
user in config file, largest value from group settings will be taken.
If the user &quot;verstandk&quot; is member of groups &quot;x2gousers&quot; and
&quot;teacher&quot;  and the config file looks like this:

[limit groups]
x2gousers=1
teacher=5

value 5 will be used. Note, that 0 is greater than anything because &quot;0&quot;
means &quot;unlimited&quot;.


Ok. That's all for now. Please test all new packages and give us your
results.
We are waiting impatiently to get your test results (and certainly new
bugreports   ;)   )

Your sincerely, X2Go Developer Team
