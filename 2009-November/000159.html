<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> first, I have to say, I am really impressed of what I read about x2go and its features. Even more so bacause it doesn't seem to be sponsored by a big company. Good work!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm about to set up a lan with a single server and 15 clients in a nursing home for older and mentaly ill people and I have a few questions. It's not development related, but since there is no other mailing list, i'll post it here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Hardware requirements for the clients: I haven't found anything on the site or in the docs, except in the &quot;linux pro magazine&quot; article where it says: 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	The current X2Go system requirements
</I>&gt;<i> 	include a display of 640x800 or more
</I>&gt;<i> 	and a client machine with an 800MHz
</I>&gt;<i> 	CPU.
</I>&gt;<i> 	This said, the Qt engine&#8217;s SVG renderer
</I>&gt;<i> 	will take 5 seconds to display the
</I>&gt;<i> 	login manager under these circumstances.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, if 800 MHz is not enough, what would be enough? What about RAM?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Hardware requirements for the server: any advice concerning cpu and RAM for 15 clients, running, say, KDE (pretty basic, without most of the bells and whistles), firefox and openoffice?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. I'd like to use diskless clients which get their boot environmnet and their kernel from the server at boot time and using x2go as the display manager. Do I have to install the regular x2go server or would the x2go server ONE be enough? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. And finally, how stable is x2go? Do you guys use it in a production environment? I have no problem filing a bug report here and there for minor things in a project like this, but those shouldn't be serious issues. If bad things happen in any significant frequency, I'd have to use nomachines nx, although I am an open source fan and would rather use x2go.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for reading this lengthy post. I hope you find the time to answer some (or all) of my questions.
</I>
we are successfully using x2go on thin clients based on diskless Intel
P-III 1 GHz which provide sufficient performance for KDE/GNOME based
desktop environments and common applications.

However reading large PDF files can force the local X11 process to
temporarily consume a lot of memory. This caused some crashes when using
only 256 MB of RAM. Upgrading to 512 MB solved this issue.
