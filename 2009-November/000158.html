<PRE>Hi everyone,

first, I have to say, I am really impressed of what I read about x2go and its features. Even more so bacause it doesn't seem to be sponsored by a big company. Good work!

I'm about to set up a lan with a single server and 15 clients in a nursing home for older and mentaly ill people and I have a few questions. It's not development related, but since there is no other mailing list, i'll post it here.

1. Hardware requirements for the clients: I haven't found anything on the site or in the docs, except in the &quot;linux pro magazine&quot; article where it says: 

	The current X2Go system requirements
	include a display of 640x800 or more
	and a client machine with an 800MHz
	CPU.
	This said, the Qt engine&#8217;s SVG renderer
	will take 5 seconds to display the
	login manager under these circumstances.

So, if 800 MHz is not enough, what would be enough? What about RAM?

2. Hardware requirements for the server: any advice concerning cpu and RAM for 15 clients, running, say, KDE (pretty basic, without most of the bells and whistles), firefox and openoffice?

3. I'd like to use diskless clients which get their boot environmnet and their kernel from the server at boot time and using x2go as the display manager. Do I have to install the regular x2go server or would the x2go server ONE be enough? 

4. And finally, how stable is x2go? Do you guys use it in a production environment? I have no problem filing a bug report here and there for minor things in a project like this, but those shouldn't be serious issues. If bad things happen in any significant frequency, I'd have to use nomachines nx, although I am an open source fan and would rather use x2go.

Thanks for reading this lengthy post. I hope you find the time to answer some (or all) of my questions.

Best regards

Peter
