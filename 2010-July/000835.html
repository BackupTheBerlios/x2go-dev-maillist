<PRE>Hello Community, Helpers and x2go users,

I'm not at homeat the moment, so I don't have time for an email
containing all topics that appeared in the last posts.

We read all emails on this list and as soon as there is the possibility,
I'll try to respond on a lot of ideas you have given.

I just wan't to point out, that we haven't been prepared for this amount
of movement and ideas.

We all wan't x2go to be a sucessfull project, but we all have different
ideas of what x2go is or should be.

I would like to handle this like debian: to combine your ideas with x2go
directly or let you create some &quot;meta distributions&quot; (like debian med or
debian edu).

It would be a great honor to collect all ideas on our site so that users
can find them directly.

We are working with git and now that is a big whish of you, the next
thin we'll do is to get git.x2go.org working.

We wan't to use our own server to be able to autobuild packages etc...
but I will push a copy to github too.

Please let us discuss the next steps, after I'm back at home...

Regards,

Heinz
