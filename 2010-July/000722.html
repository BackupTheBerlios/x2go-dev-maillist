I am indeed willing to do work and willing to contribute. And again, I  
am pushing so much, because I have to do a primary Server Based  
Computing / Thin Client Technology presentation approx. in September  
this year. Originally, I wanted to use LTSP for that.

I am willing to contribute... However, I am not really willing to  
reinvent the wheel (read and learn from code without background of  
ideas).  Neither am I willing to patch code without having a basis for  
acceptance and integration of patches into the trunk of x2go code.  
Add-ons, changes, bugfixes need to be discussed adequately. I would  
love cooking ideas and being delegated with work by Heinz and Alex and  
whoever is in the core team.

When utilizing x2go in greater contexts, I personally need the  
possibility to be able to get involved, that is to help to improve the  
product (for the benefit of my customers and the community). If that  
will be possible in the x2go project (I am talking about an increase  
of community facilities like bugtracker, code repository etc.) x2go  
will be _the_ choice for my concept (with very great enthusiasm).

Heinz and Alex are the only ones who can really comment on this, I  
guess. If the project will rather stay a founder project  
(,,Gr&#252;nderprojekt'', a few people share their work once it is ready to  
be shared, which is also fine), I will have to make my decision from a  
different angle of view.

Meaning: guidance will be very welcome indeed!!!

Good night,
Mike
