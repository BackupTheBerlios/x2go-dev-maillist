</I>&gt;<i> To get this item marked as done:

</I>&gt;<i>

One needs to understand the purpose and reasoning behind the different 
VCS tools in order to make such a decision.  'git' was developed as a 
tool for use by the Linux kernel developers after the decision was taken 
many years ago to move away from a predecessor proprietary VCS tool.  
One of the goals was to make sequences of very small commits across many 
files perform well.  And git does that rather well.  This is the life of 
a kernel developer - making the same small changes across many different 
trees.  Collaboration, distributed teaming, offline coding, none of 
these were considerations in the development of git.

On the other hand collaboration, distributed teaming and offline coding 
became increasingly important considerations as development of VCS tools 
occurred over the years especially in light of the Internet and the 
global distribution of teams.  And so as you move from cvs, to 
subversion, to mercurial and bazaar you see more and more focus on these 
qualities.  And in distributed team environments these qualities are far 
more important than whether the VCS can perform a small commit sequence 
in .186 seconds compared to .489 seconds on some distributed team VCS.  
The difference in performance is mostly negligible and unnoticeable 
until you get to projects that have beyond 50,000 files in a single 
directory.  x2go is clearly far from this type of size.

My own preference on any open source project is to use the VCS tools 
that have the most capabilities in supporting globally distributed 
development.  To that end, Bazaar (bzr), or Mercurial (hg), are the 
clear winners.  And the ability to use a fully featured forge such as 
Launchpad coupled with a fully featured distributed VCS such as Bazaar 
is very compelling.  And for those that like to work in 'git', 'svn', 
'hg', etc. there are plugins to Bazaar that allow you to work locally in 
git/svn/hg and then perform a push to the Bazaar repository on Launchpad 
when your code is ready.  I suggest you setup a small test project on 
Launchpad sandbox and try all this for yourselves.

</I>&gt;<i> The second thing on the list is the querstion where the source should be
</I>&gt;<i> stored. The place where you can find a project is in a way a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;statement&quot;. Some of those platforms are initiated by governments, some
</I>&gt;<i> are ruled by companies with added social media and data collection
</I>&gt;<i> strategies. This affects everybody who want's to collaborate, because
</I>&gt;<i> she/he needs to get an account on the chossen platform. Some platforms
</I>&gt;<i> are just not legally usable for us because of the legal situation in the
</I>&gt;<i> country of copyright: germany (for example if they use ga:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://eu.techcrunch.com/2009/11/24/google-analytics-illegal-germany/">http://eu.techcrunch.com/2009/11/24/google-analytics-illegal-germany/</A>).
</I>&gt;<i> We first tried to use BerliOS with was in our eyes a good choise because
</I>&gt;<i> in their special way, they could be called in a way (seen from the web)
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;apolitical&quot;. The account is still alive and they offer git, so it can
</I>&gt;<i> be used without any problems. Though some of the configuration is a bit
</I>&gt;<i> static and can only be access via a webgui. So there was the idea to
</I>&gt;<i> host it by our own - nobody need to register against some governmental
</I>&gt;<i> or company driven services.
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
Google Analytics has NOT been made illegal in Germany nor is it likely.  
There were a bunch of ill-informed tech-illiterate politicians running 
around making out like the sky was falling because Google was collecting 
some anonymous usage patterns.  Google does not know who you are.  They 
only know this browser with this cookie does these usage patterns.  And 
today in most browsers you can block all or specific cookies to prevent 
any usage data from being stored.  The other ill-informed paranoia was 
about IP addresses being stored out of Germany.  Well, every time you 
send an email IP addresses are stored on mail servers all over the 
world.  What many of these ill-informed politicians did not know is that 
with DHCP most people's IP addresses are constantly being changed making 
anything linked to IP addresses almost completely useless.  This whole 
baseless paranoia now seems to have calmed down as people began 
educating these politicians.


&gt;<i> It would be intersting which of the services you prefer to discuss the
</I>&gt;<i> final location of the git (osor.eu, berlios, github, sourceforge, google
</I>&gt;<i> code,...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
My preference would be either Launchpad or SourceForge.  One of the 
major forges.  People work with these on a consistent basis and are 
familiar with all of the tools available.  - No learning curve.


&gt;<i> -3-----
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After we've answered the first two questions, we should talk about which
</I>&gt;<i> of the offered tools should be used on the choosen platform. At the
</I>&gt;<i> moment the whole project management is done via this mailing list. This
</I>&gt;<i> decision was made in the past to avoid decentralized collaboration which
</I>&gt;<i> caused a lot of duplicated messages from different locations (the
</I>&gt;<i> Bugtracker on BerliOS is still active).
</I>&gt;<i> The fact we are discussing now about the future here together in one
</I>&gt;<i> place is a result of this idea. The mailing list is a very easy type of
</I>&gt;<i> service. Bugtracker can be much more complicated and sometimes you only
</I>&gt;<i> have a dictated user experience. This again can influence the choice of
</I>&gt;<i> users helping us or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So again: What do you think? Maybe gitbug is a possiblity too (bugs
</I>&gt;<i> stored inside the git)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
No need.  Just use one of the major forges and the entire suite of 
collaboration and tracking tools becomes available to use.

</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible focus could be:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    1. support the next release as best as we can (testing, bug reports etc.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the bugs are not part of our code but can be find inside the
</I>&gt;<i> used projects (xming,...). This makes it a bit harder to fix all known
</I>&gt;<i> bugs. Another thing is the status of the mac port of x2goclient:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   - we don't have mac hardware (anymore)
</I>&gt;<i>   - we don't know how to embedd the window of
</I>&gt;<i>     x2goagent inside the browserview (x2goplugin
</I>&gt;<i>     vs. style guide of mac development)
</I>&gt;<i>   - there is a big number of complaints about the
</I>&gt;<i>     mac port because it is not using cocoa and
</I>&gt;<i>     build on objective c
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    2. be happy once the release is out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> This should be worth a party :).
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
Absolutely!


&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    3. ONLY THEN: take our time to listen to each others ideas, find a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> synthesis
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      of them all and setup a working scenario that allows fluid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collaboration,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      coordinated by the core developers of X2go
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> I think we needed this exchange of ideas to get a bit more to know about
</I>&gt;<i> each other and the project.
