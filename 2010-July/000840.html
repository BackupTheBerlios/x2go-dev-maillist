Silently thinking by myself: ,,Running one's own servers... I can hear  
the system administrator's heart speak. As sysadmins, we like to be in  
control of our resources ;-) (even if they crash weekly :-O ). In  
resonance, Mike''

1.
Heinz said that he prefers to build the Debian packages on their own  
servers...

Nonetheless, people here provide reasons why a *forge site is better  
etc. I think before providing suggestions and giving all sorts of good  
advice, we should ask Heinz and Alex, why they prefer building  
packages on their servers.

If we know the answer---and it might be a very reasonable one---then  
maybe we understand their preferences or even worries and we don't  
have to haggle (,,feilschen'' in German) concerning this point.

2.
Heinz and Alex are close to the next x2go release. I think, we are  
definitely delaying them with our ideas and list postings. I think  
that discussing project structures before the release is nice but  
counter-productive. A possible focus could be:

   1. support the next release as best as we can (testing, bug reports etc.)
   2. be happy once the release is out
   3. ONLY THEN: take our time to listen to each others ideas, find a synthesis
     of them all and setup a working scenario that allows fluid collaboration,
     coordinated by the core developers of X2go

Doing all this simultaneously (as we do currently) feels very chaotic  
and not really supportive to me.

3.
We should not mix up the source development and the package  
maintenance for the various distribution (AFAIK *forge is for source  
code development, launchpad's ppa for Ubuntu package development etc.  
Canonical's Launchpad does not build Debian packages IMHO). Once there  
is a sensible point of time for this discussion i may enlarge on that.

Greetins to all,
Mike
