<PRE>Quoting &quot;John A. Sullivan III&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">jsullivan at opensourcedevel.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> We have had some complaints from clients in the last few days where they
</I>&gt;<i> have installed a fresh copy of firefox and then the latest plugin and
</I>&gt;<i> the login screen bounces up and down unusably.  That is, the blue login
</I>&gt;<i> area drops below the black background and then back up again.
</I>
I've already seen this, on a vista 15&quot; laptop. But I can't verify right now.

&gt;<i> There is apparently some known issue with the latest Firefox on sub-10&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> screens where this is a problem with Firefox.  However, one client has
</I>&gt;<i> experienced it on two normal sized laptops and we've not heard about the
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox problem affecting those.
</I>
 From my side :

On my Dell mini9 with Ubuntu x2go doesn't work, the window appears but  
isn't refreshed.

On a 17&quot; laptop running windows 7 the session crash really often, it's  
totally unusable.

And as already said, on a 15&quot; laptop the blue screen go down. But in  
my case, it doesn't bump, just go down and stay here. And if we start  
the session, the session itself go down.

I don't know how to avoid this, but perhaps you can use ssh-key ?
