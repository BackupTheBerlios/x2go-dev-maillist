Yes, a forge.  Any decent forge will suffice.  BerliOS should work.

Git is fine since you don't want to use Launchpad.

Are you referring to things like forums, wikis, bug trackers?
I thought that was what BerliOS was providing?  Isn't that the whole 
point of a forge?
To reduce the amount of administration work necessary for an open source 
project?

The source code:
     All of the historical binary and source code package archive needs 
mirrored at a public mirror (a university would be good).
     The Git repository should have plenty of people mirroring it so the 
code should be safe.

</I>&gt;<i> This paragraph is very interesting in my eyes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Generally:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> o mails / mailing lists as information service offer a passive

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mailing lists (software e.g. Mailman):
</I>...

One thing to be aware of is that there is a huge increase in the number 
of mailing lists being seriously spammed.  The python-list has recently 
been swamped with a number of spammers.  If the mailing list is to be 
unmoderated then it should be read using something like Gmane which does 
spam filtering of the posts.  If moderated, then all means of spam 
control needs to be employed.  And the spammers have gotten wiser.  They 
now post 1 or 2 topical posts before they start spamming the list.  
Probably from some of the human spam farms out there.  They're actually 
hiring farms of humans to push spam so they can get by captcha's and 
other mechanisms.  I'm now convinced that the only way we are going to 
stop spam is through legislation worldwide to make it illegal.  
Otherwise we'll be playing this cat and mouse game forever.

...

Anyway, back to x2go.  This all sounds real good.


Regards,
Gerry
