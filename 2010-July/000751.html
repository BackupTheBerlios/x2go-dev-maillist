</I>&gt;<i> LTSP is using (so far as I know) the local X-server on the Thin Client

</I>&gt;<i> So there is the question how the local apps window should be managed,
</I>&gt;<i> for example how it should be placed behind other applications, get the
</I>&gt;<i> focus.
</I>
As I understand x2go the x2goclient and also the x2go session window  
(if not fullscreen) are running on one X display (x2goclienthost:0.0).

Within the x2go session window encapsulated there is the x2goagent  
session that provides an X display applications running on the  
x2goserver (e.g. appserver:50.0).

=&gt; different hosts, different displays... this must be faced, good  
point indeed!!

I have recently looked at an eagle TC more closely. An alternative  
approach for x2go thin clients could be to provide a simple desktop  
(e.g. cream desktop environment) on the thin client (I am talking  
about Linux only for now... the approach should work on mixed setups  
i386/amd64/ppc).

On these thin clients x2goclient does not run in full screen mode, it  
rather runs as one of many client apps.

To provide local apps on the TC there are two possibilities:

   1.
   provide local apps on the thin client that use the TC's default  
user profile:

     disadvantage:
         - thin client users work anonymously with these applications
         - no individual user profiles are available

     advantage:
         - offered applications have pre-configured standard profiles
         - sensible for multimedia software
         - internet blockage can be an option (iptables/SELinux
           on the thin client)

   2.
   login to an x2go session: the session login will add desktop icons/startmenu
   entries to the thin client and provide further local applications, that can
   now be run with user privileges

         - the user's home dir will be mounted on the thin client through
           x2go (reverse sshfs)
         - thus, the user profile will be available on the TC
         - local apps can with use privs can be started by clicking a desktop
           icon on the cream desktop
         - the local CPU resources are available to these applications
         - also is the local hardware available
         - users are indentifiable on the network (e.g. for  
firefox/dansguardian)

Consequently, using such a thin client would be like this:

  o turn on TC
  o boot the TC image from the net (NBD rather than NFS???)
  o optional: boot a TC image that also installs a thin client image on the
    local -&gt; netbooks with wireless network could be used as TCs
  o the user is offered a cream desktop with an x2goclient, mplayer, ...
  o the user starts x2goclient
  o and initiate an x2go client session (LDAP based, x2gocluster
    auto-assignment)
  o x2go now does in the background:
        - pulseaudio: server -&gt; client
        - cupsprinting: server -&gt; client (actually this is filesharing: client
                        -&gt; server)
        - filesharing: client -&gt; server
        - homesharing: server -&gt; client (sshfs)
        - x2go extends thin client cream desktop: icons, startmenu entries

  o you now can choose while you work:
        1. run apps within the x2go session (windows within a window)
        2. run anonymous local apps (app windows, x2goclient main window and #
           x2go session window share one desktop)
        3. run other local apps under your server uid

&gt;<i> There are further questions like: &quot;what is happening on session
</I>&gt;<i> suspend,
</I>
   o speakout a warning...
   o kill local TC apps that run under the user's server uid
   o disconnect home dir (reverse sshfs unmount)
   o disconnect everything else (pulse, fileshares, ...)

&gt;<i> concurring audio input,
</I>
What exactly do you mean by this?

&gt;<i> a different client cpu architecture,...
</I>
Thinclient arch and server arch can differ. Of course your thinclients  
and the provided thinclient images must match in architecture... (i386  
mostly).

&gt;<i> This is not a &quot;not possible&quot; answer, we sure will add this feature to
</I>&gt;<i> the whislist. But it is not a easy task and maybe some other ideas will
</I>&gt;<i> help to archive the same result.
</I>
The above differs from my original idea as I had not taken the window  
management of local apps that much into account. Thus, it got a bit  
complexer now, blown up by a cream desktop.

If you have other ideas to make local CPU resources accessible let me know.

&gt;&gt;<i> My question: is there also an idea or an approach for x2go how local CPU
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usage of thin clients could be implemented? I suppose, there is no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation yet, is it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The local machine is used for input device handling, as print server and
</I>&gt;<i> the local X-Server is responsible for the display response user experience.
</I>
The great advantage of this approach is clarity!!! One machine is the  
server, the other machine is the client. The approach is very valuable  
but also has its limits when it comes to

   o running CPU intensive processes (yukky Flashplayer e.g.)
   o accessing local hardware in schools' computer labs
   o playing movies from local devices

&gt;&gt;<i> As this is probably the most needed feature herearound I'd love to go
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into detail with this issue sometime in August/September.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Plz let me know what you think,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mike
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it is a very difficult task and if you don't want to offer it to
</I>&gt;<i> all target devices available it might be possible for LAN usage. But it
</I>&gt;<i> is sure a lot of work.
</I>
1.
LAN usage should definitely be the first target.

2.
Next could be a backgrounded thinclient image installer for Netbook  
Thinclients:

   o all LAN-clients receive a thinclient only image
   o but now you plugin one of the schools netbooks that also shall be able
     to use Wireless LAN
   o these netbooks that get recognized by its mac address retrieve the
     thinclient+background-installer image
   o while the session is running, a local thinclient image is installed to the
     hard or solidstate disk of the netbook
   o shutdown
   o unplug LAN
   o boot netbook from disk
   o thinclient starts from disk with WiFi support
   o upgrade your netbook TC image: plugin on LAN again, boot from the net...

3.
Difficult on Windows Systems (Home dir useless, sucking registry ...).  
It might be possible to find solutions for individual applications  
(e.g. firefox).

4.
MacOS is a Unix derivative... But I have not played with Macs that  
often. Magic like this should be possible on Macs rather than on  
windows clients

One demand probably is that software versions on thinclients and on  
the terminalserver should not differ too much, if you want to use the  
user profiled local application thing. For admins this will mean that  
they have to keep their thinclient images rather up-to-date (i.e. run  
same distroversion as the servers). Thin clients then also need  
security updates regularly...

&gt;<i> best regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Heinz
</I>
Thanks for your input!!!
Mike
