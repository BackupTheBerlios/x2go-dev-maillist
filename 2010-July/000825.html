<PRE>Hi.

Well, using VCS doesn't mean that you are giving away power/leadership
of the project. Using VCS means saving a lot of time and being a lot
more productive, even if you do not accept any contribution of anybody.
I agree with most of your points, but I didn't read any reason against
using VCS. 
I'd love to work 1-2 hours per day on x2go, but NOT on source code that
is a couple of months or even years old and send tar.gz through e-mail
until the confusion is perfect and nobody knows who's talking about what
state/revision of the code. But it is all right if you don't want that
free gift.
And no, VCS is not just a way to download files that could also be put
in a .tar.gz - VCS is the one and only way to make structured open, fast
and reliable development possible. If you don't believe me, ask anybody
who has worked in a professional software project. 

Anyway, this is my last mail on this subject - I have offered you my
support and you don't want it for reasons I don't know.
Please do not complain if an &quot;x2go-ng&quot; project appears on github in the
next few months - I need to help myself and my clients - and well, I
have asked you before.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hello Gerry,
</I>&gt;<i> hello list members,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please have a look back in time. A few months before there was not much 
</I>&gt;<i> traffic on this list and we've known every member of our community by 
</I>&gt;<i> name and face. Our community mainly is and was Linux4Afrika and later 
</I>&gt;<i> the german branch skolelinux  too.
</I>&gt;<i> Both projects are known to be aware about what open source is and both 
</I>&gt;<i> projects have choosen to use x2go. This is because they where able to 
</I>&gt;<i> modify it to their needs and to adopt own ideas. Upstream in this case 
</I>&gt;<i> means, that those modifications have been released in their projects, 
</I>&gt;<i> because the changes have been very specific to their solutions.
</I>&gt;<i> Now this situation changes and x2go is getting more popular. But there 
</I>&gt;<i> are still a huge number of users (schools, institutions and companies) 
</I>&gt;<i> who rely on x2go and it's compatibility. x2go has its own &quot;history&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> Every part of the new relase contains wishes from those and the people 
</I>&gt;<i> on the list.
</I>&gt;<i> x2go has been and will ever be open source software. Furthermore it is 
</I>&gt;<i> based on existing open source software. This is - in our eyes - the only 
</I>&gt;<i> way x2go should be developed. Even more there is a vision / a target 
</I>&gt;<i> which we want to reach some day, which will help a lot of other projects 
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; getting the needed nx features realized using a modern xorg version. 
</I>&gt;<i> The sources have ever been online and will stay there and they are used 
</I>&gt;<i> by others like the maintainers of other distros (they could not build 
</I>&gt;<i> their packages if not - f.e. Gentoo). Please don't mix the governance of 
</I>&gt;<i> a project with the accuse of GPL violation.
</I>&gt;<i> We can't answer every email on the list, but we are reading it. And if 
</I>&gt;<i> you follow the development of x2go, you'll see that there is a big 
</I>&gt;<i> accordance between the wishes / bugreports and the features of a new 
</I>&gt;<i> release.
</I>&gt;<i> I would suggest we should discuss the idea of drawing a line between 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;mainstream&quot;, &quot;contributions&quot; and maybe &quot;spins&quot;. We will definitly go on 
</I>&gt;<i> developing x2go (mainstream) as a to itself compatible and complete 
</I>&gt;<i> project. We will accept contributions in this branch, but they should be
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * in the mind of &quot;the whole&quot; idea of x2go (a server based computing 
</I>&gt;<i> environment)
</I>&gt;<i> * not be destroying work already done
</I>&gt;<i> * maintainable by more than the submitting person
</I>&gt;<i> * usable for more than one specific use case only
</I>&gt;<i> * helping to make it possible to use recent xorg versions with the 
</I>&gt;<i> nxlibs features
</I>&gt;<i> * helping to get x2go inside debian
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And (again):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PLEASE use the list as communication tool! I received a lot of emails 
</I>&gt;<i> about this topic in my private inbox. Keep your answers polite and help 
</I>&gt;<i> this discussion to be productive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice to ask some questions first, before publishing your own 
</I>&gt;<i> truth. For example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why do you publish your code as tar.gz archive inside your repository?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure there are tools on this earth that make some things easier. But not 
</I>&gt;<i> using this tools don't means &quot;forbidding&quot; something like contributions. 
</I>&gt;<i> John has already used the list for this purpose and as far as I know it 
</I>&gt;<i> is already used by other users. We will use our online git as planned 
</I>&gt;<i> and we'll always thankfully awaiting patches and contributions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To get back on the &quot;communication issue&quot;: As far as I know &quot;we&quot; (or 
</I>&gt;<i> anybody else) never had communicate a final result about &quot;how open x2go 
</I>&gt;<i> is&quot;. So this discussion needs to be done before accusing this project to 
</I>&gt;<i> be &quot;what ever the result will be&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you like to help other projects than x2go, please help them by 
</I>&gt;<i> contributing and not by boycott this on. Nobody is forced to use x2go 
</I>&gt;<i> and everybody can do whatever he want's to do as he can access the code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Alex &amp; Heinz
