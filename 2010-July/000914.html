</I>You're right Jo. My ignorance is sticking out. I've been with Linux for quite a
while, but know little about authorization.
Yes. It is absolutely essential that the users be authorized. I'll try to
clarify my question:
Since there are so many examinees, we need an automated procedure to generate
authorization for them. I had thought that granting each her own Linux login
would be unnecessary, since all she has to do is access the one application with
a browser front end.
LDAP sounds like just the thing. Do you know of an application which would
automatically generate the necessary (keys?), user authorizations, etc. so we
wouldn't have to fiddle with individual user permissions, directories, etc.,
taking them straight from one default permissions template?
