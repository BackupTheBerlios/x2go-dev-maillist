that is because no reasons were stated.

</I>&gt;<i> And no, VCS is not just a way to download files that could also be put

I heard stories about the development environments in professional
software projects in some companies. I guess you would run away
screaming. ;-)

&gt;<i> Anyway, this is my last mail on this subject - I have offered you my
</I>&gt;<i> support and you don't want it for reasons I don't know.
</I>&gt;<i> Please do not complain if an &quot;x2go-ng&quot; project appears on github in the

I talked to Heinz at LinuxTag and read his answers. As far as I
understood, they are using a VCS (Git) already and they are going to
make it public!

But it will take them some time. So we could argue about the correct
order of the priority list, but I suggest to be patient a little more
and to be optimistic that this will happen soon.

Seeing all you people raring to go to get your hands dirty, I am looking
forward to all your contributions!


Thanks,

Paul
