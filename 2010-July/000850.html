If you have two main developers, I would take that into consideration.
And since there is no big community yet, nobody knows what the community
is going to prefer.

&gt;<i> When you look at the massive success of forges such as Launchpad and

</I>&gt;<i> forges are extremely good at providing all of the infrastructure, 
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration tools, tracking tools, and source code management tools 
</I>&gt;<i> for an open source project.
</I>
I also heard of some projects moving away from those services.

&gt;<i> To try and duplicate this type of free services using your own hardware,

As I have already written.

1. Independence. There is the danger that you are locked into the
project and depend on their reaction time. See the BerliOS and renaming
the mailing list issues. Using a server for yourself you are in control
of it.

2. As I have written. Maybe it is no overhead for Alex or Heinz since
they need to administer a server and those services anyway. We both do
not know that.


Thanks,

Paul
