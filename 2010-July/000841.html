<PRE>Hello,

I think we need to talk about 3 different things:

1. source code hosting/modification/interactivity/versioning

2. the place where the code shoud be stored

3. the tools which should be used for organisation


All three items have become mixed up in some mails and discussions.
Again I had a lot of private mails - again: please post those things to
the list (especially regarding those topics).


-1-----

The first item is the question how the source of x2go should be
published/handled. The big surprise: we don't have a discussion about
what technique should be used (bzr, cvs, git, svn,...).
To get this item marked as done:

Is it ok to use git as &quot;version control and code publishing tool&quot;?


-2-----

The second thing on the list is the querstion where the source should be
stored. The place where you can find a project is in a way a
&quot;statement&quot;. Some of those platforms are initiated by governments, some
are ruled by companies with added social media and data collection
strategies. This affects everybody who want's to collaborate, because
she/he needs to get an account on the chossen platform. Some platforms
are just not legally usable for us because of the legal situation in the
country of copyright: germany (for example if they use ga:
<A HREF="http://eu.techcrunch.com/2009/11/24/google-analytics-illegal-germany/">http://eu.techcrunch.com/2009/11/24/google-analytics-illegal-germany/</A>).
We first tried to use BerliOS with was in our eyes a good choise because
in their special way, they could be called in a way (seen from the web)
&quot;apolitical&quot;. The account is still alive and they offer git, so it can
be used without any problems. Though some of the configuration is a bit
static and can only be access via a webgui. So there was the idea to
host it by our own - nobody need to register against some governmental
or company driven services.

It would be intersting which of the services you prefer to discuss the
final location of the git (osor.eu, berlios, github, sourceforge, google
code,...).


-3-----

After we've answered the first two questions, we should talk about which
of the offered tools should be used on the choosen platform. At the
moment the whole project management is done via this mailing list. This
decision was made in the past to avoid decentralized collaboration which
caused a lot of duplicated messages from different locations (the
Bugtracker on BerliOS is still active).
The fact we are discussing now about the future here together in one
place is a result of this idea. The mailing list is a very easy type of
service. Bugtracker can be much more complicated and sometimes you only
have a dictated user experience. This again can influence the choice of
users helping us or not.

So again: What do you think? Maybe gitbug is a possiblity too (bugs
stored inside the git)?


As this was a response to Mike's mail:

Am 18.07.2010 14:42, schrieb Mike Gabriel:
&gt;<i> possible focus could be:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   1. support the next release as best as we can (testing, bug reports etc.)
</I>
Most of the bugs are not part of our code but can be find inside the
used projects (xming,...). This makes it a bit harder to fix all known
bugs. Another thing is the status of the mac port of x2goclient:

 - we don't have mac hardware (anymore)
 - we don't know how to embedd the window of
   x2goagent inside the browserview (x2goplugin
   vs. style guide of mac development)
 - there is a big number of complaints about the
   mac port because it is not using cocoa and
   build on objective c

&gt;<i>   2. be happy once the release is out
</I>
This should be worth a party :).

&gt;<i>   3. ONLY THEN: take our time to listen to each others ideas, find a
</I>&gt;<i> synthesis
</I>&gt;<i>     of them all and setup a working scenario that allows fluid
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration,
</I>&gt;<i>     coordinated by the core developers of X2go
</I>
I think we needed this exchange of ideas to get a bit more to know about
each other and the project.

Regards,

Heinz
