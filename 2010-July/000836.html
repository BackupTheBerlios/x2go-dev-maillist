<PRE>Hi Heinz,

that all sounds very good and promising.

&gt;<i> I would like to handle this like debian: to combine your ideas with x2go
</I>&gt;<i> directly or let you create some &quot;meta distributions&quot; (like debian med or
</I>&gt;<i> debian edu).
</I>A good idea in general, but I am not sure if this makes sense with a
rather small project (compared to a whole linux distribution). What kind
of flavours/meta distributions should x2go have? With linux
distributions, it is different, because users have a lot of different
purposes like using it in education, in a small business, on a netbook
or an embedded system like a router or a smartphone.

But x2go? Isn't the purpose of all users to create a fast and reliable
terminal server environment? x2go-edu? x2go-netbook-edition? :o) 

Maybe I am on the wrong track, but I can hardly imagine a single meta
distribution of x2go that would make sense.

My suggestion: Make ONE x2go-core that you maintain and where you decide
what contributions and features you include - everything else (things
that have specific purposes not needed by all users) is provided as
plugin/module that is maintained by the contributor himself. Saves you
work, makes it easy for contributors and is a very clear concept. I'd
rather install one x2go and choose the additional modules I need instead
of trying x2go-foo, x2go-edu, x2go-bar to see what could fit best.

&gt;<i> We are working with git and now that is a big whish of you, the next
</I>&gt;<i> thin we'll do is to get git.x2go.org working.
</I>Why don't you use github or *forge? It saves time and money and you have
the same (and more) possibilities than with your own server.
Apart from that, you'd have to setup a bug tracker, wiki and stuff like
that as well - and run, administer, update and maintain it. I'd rather
invest my time to get on with development instead of reinventing the
wheel at this point. :)

&gt;<i> We wan't to use our own server to be able to autobuild packages etc...
</I>&gt;<i> but I will push a copy to github too.
</I>There is absolutely no need for this - for example, if you have a
project page on Launchpad, their servers can autobuild .deb packages for
you - for all kinds of architectures and ubuntu/debian versions.
If you still want to build packages on your own server, just build them
from the github/*forge repository. 

Of course it is up to you - but keep in mind that it will cost you a lot
more time (and money) to build and run an infrastructure that is as good
or better than what all these *forge sites offer you for free.

J&#246;rg
