<PRE>Hey,

even though I don't think anybody is violating the terms of the GPL, I'd
say X2go is not a true open source project. What you are doing is more
like commercial vendors develop software: A few guys develop a product,
while the community has no insight at all and from time to time you
publish a release and as a free bonus you give a way the sources as
well.
You could also publish it under some commercial license - it wouldn't
matter. It is nice that you use the GPL, that makes it LEGALLY possible
to contribute to your product, but technically it is impossible. The
community has no effective way to actively take part in the development.
Are there any reasons why you don't want others to contribute with their
ideas, bug fixes etc.?
There are dozens of people outside who want to help you, you are short
on time, but somehow it seems you don't want help. 

Making a source code repository public is less than 2 minutes work....
If you are not already under version control, you should take 5 minutes
and you will never regret it, because it will save you hours later.
Give me a shout if you need help with this.

After all, it is of course your very own decision, but from my own open
source experience I can only recommend you to do it as soon as possible.
Development depends on TWO people - the number of users, bug reports,
feature requests will exponentially grow - and the amount of work will
grow. Your resources are static - this means, it will take a lot longer
until a new feature is implemented or a bug is fixed. As people are
impatient, they will start to help themselves, make a fork &quot;X2go Next
Generation&quot; and it will be out of your control. So, be smart, honor the
community's effort, use it, coordinate, decide about what code to accept
and what to refuse, what features to integrate into the core project,
publically represent the project and control it's direction.

These are my personal thoughts on this - I wish you that you will find a
wise and satisfying way how to go on. 

Thanks a lot for the excellent work you have already done!

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The SourceCode of x2go is published on the same place as the binary
</I>&gt;<i> packages. For example &quot;x2goclient&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/pool-lenny/x2goclient/x2goclient_3.01-5.tar.gz">http://x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/pool-lenny/x2goclient/x2goclient_3.01-5.tar.gz</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can browse the repository just with your favorite Browser:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/pool-lenny/">http://x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/pool-lenny/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As you'll see there is a source tar.gz for every version. There are also
</I>&gt;<i> the needed packages of the nx libs. For example nxcomp:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/pool-lenny/nxcomp/">http://x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/pool-lenny/nxcomp/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As the gpl want's the code stored where you can find the software, I
</I>&gt;<i> think this way of publishing the code should be conform to the rules.
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the packages have reached an age above 3 years...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The URL you have used was printed quoted an announcement. It will be
</I>&gt;<i> used in future.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the moment we really use our limited time to get some of your ideas
</I>&gt;<i> and found bugs inside the new release. After the new version is out, I
</I>&gt;<i> wan't to invite our list members (and anybody intersted) to a irc
</I>&gt;<i> session to talk about the future.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
