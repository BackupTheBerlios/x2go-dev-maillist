<PRE>Hello x2gousers,

let's start this mail with the good news. After reading the next lines,
you'll be able to test the new features of our new release. You'll just
have to add the following line to your /etc/apt/sources.list:

deb <A HREF="http://x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/">http://x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/</A> heuler main

Please don't remove the main x2go repository. After doing an apt-get
update you'll be able to access new versions of x2goclient, x2goserver
and the new packages x2godesktopsharing and x2goplasmoid. The new
packages are not yet named 3.1 (planned version number of baikal).
Little baby seals a called &quot;Heuler&quot; in german, so this is a preview and
not the new release. Please keep in mind, that there are still some
things need to be done before we can do the &quot;real&quot; release.

The new features/changelog:

x2goclient
old 3.01-5 new 3.01-11
New features:
  * plugin config options sound, exportfs, adsl, compression, quality,
dpi, kbdlayout, kbdtype
  * embeded mode for firefox plugin
  * updated interface
  * support for fs encodings
  * shadow sessions
  * xdmcp sessions
  * commandline option for printing in LDAP mode

x2goserver
old 3.01-5 new 3.01-9
New features:
  * support for kde4 plasmoid
  * support for fs encodings
  * support for session sharing

new packages:
x2godesktopsharing
x2goplasmoid

not updated:
x2goclient-gtk

Following issues are known:
Connections to localhost are known to be problematic. We'll work on this
issue.
On some distros (with a different zip application to debian) the plugin
content is unzipped without the applied user rights. In this case
firefox crashes during the visit of a site containing the plugin. You
can avoid this by running following command inside the users home directory:

chmod +x
.mozilla/firefox/[profile]/extensions/<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">x2goplugin at obviously-nice.de</A>/x2goclient/x2goclient

Don't use the x2goldaptools for generating a LDAP config on top of
debian squeeze (debian made a change to gnutls).

We'll work on those and on the reported bugs.

Please keep in mind, that those packages are meant for testing. In the
next days we'll add documentation of the new features to the wiki:

best regards,

Alex &amp; Heinz
