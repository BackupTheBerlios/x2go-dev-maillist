I get your point about VCS completely, GIT is planned by the  
developers for the very near future. It will come after the next  
release is out. As a contributer, working on the most recent code base  
is absolutely necessary for providing your contributions.

However, I strongly think, that we should focus our brains and hearts  
on a common solution for X2go!!!

Maybe this needs time, patience and also a soft perception for the  
needs, wishes and hesitations of others. You can never go too deep,  
but only too fast...

Similar to you, I am currently working on a terminal server concept  
for schools in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Maybe there is interest on  
your side to share ideas and approaches. Please contact me privately  
(and in German) if you like.

Best,
Mike
