You certainly have our support and appreciation here at Pacifera.  I've
been biting my tongue (or should that be my fingers!) on this thread.  I
think you are receiving a lot of undeserved, unnecessary, and
distracting grief.

I can say I've been working with Heinz and Alex on and off for the last
two years and have found them pleasant, honest, and helpful.  As far as
I can see there is no hidden agenda, power mongering, control issues, or
even major financial incentive such as open core.  There is just the
very practical issue of two great guys with full time jobs trying to
contribute a big project to the world.  THANK YOU.

I can quite understand.  I maintain a languishing open source project
which, after eight years still does things no other security product can
do but I've not been able to take it forward.  I've had people volunteer
and there were just not enough hours in the day to even educate, guide,
and direct the volunteers.  Sometimes there are just not enough time.

Correspondingly, I've had to work harder on this project than others
(find the code, not always get answers to questions on the code in a
timely manner or at all) but, as a result, I've been able to contribute
and help pick up the slack rather than just consume.

So, as someone far outside the development team, let me say there are
not power issues here - just time issues.  Let's please minimize
distraction to Heinz and Alex and pick up the ball ourselves wherever
possible.  Thanks - John
