</I>I don't know about Gnome as I've not used it but I would guess it would
work just fine.  I do have pulse installed on the server.  Pulse talks
to pulse across the network so it must be installed on both sides.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On the server side, we needed to upgrade paplay from Squeeze as the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lenny version did not support playing the ogg files sometimes used for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; KDE sounds.  In the knotifyrc configuration file (~/.kde/share/config/
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unless you are using KIOSK mode), we set External player=paplay.  Of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; course, this is just for KDE.  Anything which natively uses pulse should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work although you may need to configure the application to use pulse.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We had some issues with Firefox (Iceweasel) but I believe these were
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cleaned up with upgrades although we might have needed to install from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; either backports or squeeze; if it is a problem, let the list know and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'll see if I can dig out what we did.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe squeeze gets stable in the next couple of weeks and so it is not
</I>&gt;<i> important anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Most importantly, is pulse actually running on both sides, e.g., ps -e |
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grep pulse? Good luck - John
</I>&gt;<i> On the server I had to create /etc/asound.conf after the installation of 
</I>&gt;<i> the packages and to add the users in the pulse groups. Furthermore I had 
</I>&gt;<i> to start it with &quot;pulseaudio -D&quot;. But I have to find out if there is a 
</I>&gt;<i> way to start it automatically at startup.
</I>&gt;<i> But the bigger problem is how to start pulse in the client?
</I>&lt;snip&gt;
Yes, we found our initial problems were because pulse was not running.
I believe pulse is configured to start on boot in the init sequences
when it is installed in Lenny but I'm not sure.  I do not recall doing
anything special on the client side - John
