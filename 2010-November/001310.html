</I>Ok, so if you don't have to configure the windowmanager
will it work in gnome as well? You don't have installed pulse on
the server?

</I>Maybe squeeze gets stable in the next couple of weeks and so it is not
important anymore.


&gt;<i> Most importantly, is pulse actually running on both sides, e.g., ps -e |
</I>&gt;<i> grep pulse? Good luck - John
</I>On the server I had to create /etc/asound.conf after the installation of 
the packages and to add the users in the pulse groups. Furthermore I had 
to start it with &quot;pulseaudio -D&quot;. But I have to find out if there is a 
way to start it automatically at startup.
But the bigger problem is how to start pulse in the client?
