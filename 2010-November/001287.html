I don't understand what a &quot;big installation/context&quot; is. Most admins 
just want a remote desktop for the servers they administer. Me too. I 
don't have a reason to use Postgre for anything.

So it's a big server, and I want a remote desktop to it for 
administrative purposes.  Do you recommend to install Postgre and the 
normal x2goserver on it?  I was under the impression that the home 
version was -home.  The one person version was -one.  I'm one person, 
and I want me, and only me, to be able to login per x2go.  So I 
installed -one.

I suggest the installation to be adapted to this. -home might add users 
to x2gousers, but why -one?

Also, what's the point in adding users like &quot;apache&quot; and &quot;mysql&quot; to 
x2gousers and fuse?
