<PRE>My wife borrowed my laptop last night, so I decided to try and see if I
could get any of the other X2Go clients to work, as I'd been having
display corruption problems (see previous emails - might actually be a
display driver issue, not an X2Go issue).

1. Maemo: Couldn't install it on my N900, because it hadn't been rebuilt
or reimplemented for Maemo 5, so that was a non-starter.

2. Windows XP: A dialog box popped up saying &quot;Could not start the X server&quot;.
Xming was installed. When I ran Xming myself, x2goclient just hung when
I tried to connect. Well, didn't do anything anyway. Every time.

3. Mac OS X 10.5.8, using the latest XQuartz X server: Works fine, except,
bizarrely, Ctrl+S has *no* effect in emacs! Just plain 's' works; ctrl +
other keys works; ctrl+s works if I just use straight X11-over-the-network
to run emacs. It's very strange. Any ideas as to what might be happening?
(I have selected &quot;keep existing keyboard layout&quot;, because selecting a
keyboard layout explicitly in the Linux client didn't work - keys were
wrongly mapped.)

Regards,
