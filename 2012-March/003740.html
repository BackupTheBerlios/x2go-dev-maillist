Yes, that's what I was guessing more or less and why I was a little
concerned about the patch despite my ignorance.  I'm guessing the magic
is removing DoNumCopies but that seems quite counter-intuitive.  I'm
wondering if there is a bug in gs for Windows or whatever is generating
the file and making this change is accommodating a bug at who knows what
expense.

If I recall correctly, we did have some problems printing from Windows
TS and I believe it had to do with the file being processed through
ps2pdf or some other utility twice.  We solved it by making the X2Go
printers in TS raw printers and that seemed to work (except in the odd
case where the application directly queries the printer for its
capabilities).  Thanks - John
