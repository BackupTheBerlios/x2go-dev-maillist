&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> thanks to Stefan we have another puzzle piece for making X2Go the
</I>&gt;<i> non-plus-ultra solution for people offering Linux-SaaS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There now is a new session mode called ,,Published Applications'',
</I>&gt;<i> sponsored by Stefan Baur.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have had a quick test look at the functionality, so here is a feedback
</I>&gt;<i> list, also about other issues that I stumble upon while testing:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - I use a dark Qt color theme, with a dark color theme some elements of
</I>&gt;<i>    x2goclient are hardly readable on screen:
</I>&gt;<i>      - session profile cards (right column of the screen=
</I>&gt;<i>      - all buttons (suspend, new, terminate, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>      - also the button that allows me to launch a published application is
</I>&gt;<i>        not readable on screen with my dark theme
</I>
Okay, I understand your problem, I'll set up a colour palette for font
in this widgets.

&gt;<i>      - when minimizing x2goclient to systray, I see an icon with
</I>&gt;<i> transparent
</I>&gt;<i>        background and black contours on a black system tray. Thus, I
</I>&gt;<i> actually
</I>&gt;<i>        see nothing...
</I>
I think, we should change a X2Go Icon and set a light background colour
instead of transparency.

BTW - this issues are not related to &quot;Published Applications&quot; feature, I
think it is not correct to discuss them in topic with such subject.

&gt;<i>   - Published applications: Some menu entries have icons, some do not.
</I>&gt;<i> Where
</I>&gt;<i>     do icons come from? Are they transferred from the server? Or are they
</I>&gt;<i>     used from the client-side file system?
</I>
the icons are transferred from the server, certainly. You can find a
directory list, where X2Go server searching for icons in the
&quot;x2gogetapps&quot;. If you just made a link /etc/x2go/applications -&gt;
/usr/share/applications you will get a list with all possible desktops.
Some of them are not in fact desktop applications and have no icons in
directories like &quot;&lt;theme path&gt;/&lt;icon size&gt;/apps&quot;. I think, for 99% of
applications, which you really want to publish on your server,
x2gogetapps will find the icon. In all other cases administrator just
should put the icon in one of generic icons directory - for example in
/usr/share/icons/hicolor/22x22/apps/. If some one have a better idea
about icon resolution algorithm, feel free to talk with me about it.

&gt;<i>   - x2goclient is configure _not_ to minimize into the systray. After
</I>&gt;<i>     establishing a published application session I see for buttons in the
</I>&gt;<i>     center of the blue window area of x2goclient. The buttons do not fit in
</I>&gt;<i>     there (they overlap).
</I>
I see, you font size is just too large. I'll think, how I can solve this
problem. I should find another place for &quot;Applications...&quot; button.


&gt;<i>   - Is there a concept for evaluating i18n parts of desktop files?
</I>&gt;<i> Application
</I>&gt;<i>     links appear in English still.
</I>
Actually, all localized strings from desktop files are transferred to
client. For example, if you client localization is de_DE, the strings
Name[de] and Comment[de] will be used to describe your application in
x2goclient. If this fields are not present in &quot;desktop&quot; file, &quot;Name&quot; and
&quot;Comment&quot; will be used.

&gt;<i>   - Alex, whenever we are about to release the new code, we should make
</I>&gt;<i> a call
</I>&gt;<i>     for translation, so that i18n files are updated with the new version
</I>
Good idea. But I don't think, that it is a target for developers. I
think we should found a &quot;localization&quot; group, which will take care about
localization. Volunteers?

&gt;<i> So much from the testing front here...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BTW: x2goserver installs and uninstalls/purges fine, I added the code in
</I>&gt;<i> a rush this lunch time, but it seems to work well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mike
</I>Nice. I'll  try to install packets from repo.

regards,
Alex
