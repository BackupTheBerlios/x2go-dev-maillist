We do have a request for &quot;intelligent media transportation&quot; development.
We do have an exact plan to integrate this, but what I don't know is, if
the customer will pay for it. A further question is, wether the result
can be released as part of x2go, because the code will go to the owner.
Maybe there will be a possibility to develop this part as a sponsored
feature too.

But first we'll have to finish our work on the new release. As Linuxtag
is approaching fast, we needed to spend time on our booth and the things
we'll show. We'll be able to show every feature of the new release (even
the plasmoid), but we'll not be able to do the packaging in the last day
before Linuxtag - sorry. But after Linuxtag has ended this will be the
next task after making the new release accessible via git.

The next feature after the new release is published will be as described
before the USB portable Windows Client.

After that we'll discuss the &quot;intelligent media transportation&quot;. Our
Plan is to have XV Channel which will transport the Output to the Client
where it should be rendered. This can be used by every media player
which can use the XV extension.

I've almost finished the work on the wiki so with the new release we'll
make some changes to the website. I've choosen &quot;dokuwiki&quot; as it is just
doing what it should do.

see you on Linuxtag,

Heinz
