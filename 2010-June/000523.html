This is a comment on my own mail:

A bad thing about the communication with &quot;x2go&quot; (now) is, that really a
huge number of people are using the contact form to contact us. So a lot
of criticism and requests are not posted in public. So I post now the
most sent topics to us:

387 times: NX Compatibility needed
276 times: x2goserver running on windows (PLEASE!!!)
263 times: &quot;ubuntu&quot;
104 times: USB Forward
101 times: Display sharing
99 times: Multimedia Support
98 times: Ajax/PHP Client
90 times: PHP Administration Interface
67 times: Translation

I've created the list by searching for content inside the Subject line.
So this is not a 100% accurate List but it shows us a bit, what
x2gousers are thinking about.

And we'll try to work on the items on the list, which can be &quot;really&quot;
done. And &quot;multimedia support&quot; is one of the wishes we really wan't to
work on.

The nice thing about &quot;sponsored development&quot; is, that the result can go
back to the project and everybody can use it. And of cause it helps us
to buy some things we need for the development and representation like
on the Linuxtag.

So if there is the chance to develop a feature and to get some help, we
try to do so.

To get back to the topic &quot;communication&quot;: We consider to close the Form
or to write some lines to invite the people to write to the list.

And we really think it will help us, when the x2go-community site is up
and running (good luck Tobias!!!). Maybe somebody can help him with his
typo3 issue!?

bye,

Heinz
