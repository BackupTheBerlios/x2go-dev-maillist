&gt;<i> Hi there,

</I>&gt;<i> my name is Mike Gabriel and I have recently taken a closer look at x2go.

Welcome to the list ;-)

&gt;<i> I must say, it is a fabulous project/product and as I will probably have
</I>&gt;<i> needs for a SBC/TC environment like x2go I would like to offer support,
</I>&gt;<i> skills and resources:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   o vhosts for testing (on root servers, available sometime in
</I>&gt;<i>     September/Octobre)
</I>&gt;<i>     this year)
</I>&gt;<i>   o webspace, db-storage, kolab groupware accounts
</I>&gt;<i>   o skills in Perl, Python, PHP
</I>&gt;<i>   o genuine skills in Ubuntu/Debian system administration
</I>&gt;<i>   o genuine skills in communication (at least I hope I have them)
</I>&gt;<i>   o I won't be much help with the x2goclient, but I think I can add
</I>&gt;<i>     great support to the server aspects of x2go...
</I>
Sounds nice !

&gt;<i> I live in Kiel, Germany and currently I am working on a SBC/Opensource
</I>&gt;<i> concept for a couple of grammar schools herearound.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> During the testing of x2go I have stumbled over quite some issues that I
</I>&gt;<i> would like to report to the current developer team. As I have found no
</I>&gt;<i> bugtracker with the project, I guess addressing the x2go-dev list will
</I>&gt;<i> be best, won't it?
</I>
It's OK.

&gt;<i> I would like to open a single thread per issue (as opposed to stuffing
</I>&gt;<i> all issues into one longish mail). So discussion can wrap around each
</I>&gt;<i> thread individually...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I understand a new release of x2go is coming up soon. Thus, I would
</I>&gt;<i> like to avoid reporting deprecated issues/bugs/problems. Are there any
</I>&gt;<i> release candidates, yet? 
</I>
The new version is ready, but the packaging is not. I expect the
packaging will be ready very soon.

There is an older release candidate, but it does not work well.

&gt;<i> Or is the git repository already up, so I can
</I>&gt;<i> take a look into the sources?
</I>
I see something here: <A HREF="https://git.x2go.org">https://git.x2go.org</A>
Not sure it works, I don't have a username/password...

&gt;<i> Let me know how I can support your team!
</I>
Heinz can answer this question the best, I think.

I would like a rewritten x2gopgwrapper script what does not mess-up my
auth.log file with sudo-messages.

With regards,
Paul van der Vlis.
