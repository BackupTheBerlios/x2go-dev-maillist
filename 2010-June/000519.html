I don't have an answer to your question.  It is an issue for us, too.
My ignorant understanding is the algorithms used to optimize partial
screen changes as one does when typing a document are very different
from optimizing the massive screen changes needed for video.  Other
protocols that handle video well (such as SPICE from what I hear), do
not work well across WAN links.

But, without wanting to hijack your thread, I'm very curious about your
ssh comments as this is a big issue for us and we've been wondering how
to optimize ssh for greater resilience on bad connections.  What changes
has Ubuntu made to the SSH settings to create this improvement? Would
you mind posting your SSH version, sshd_config and ssh_config files so
we can see if those are just setting tweaks that we can mimic in Debian
Lenny? Thanks - John
