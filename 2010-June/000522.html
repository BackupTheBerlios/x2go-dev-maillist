</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Anyway my main question would be will video playback be looked into? Since
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with ubuntu 10.04 out and most of the things I have tried seems to have enhanced
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the speed of ssh and stability. Though most people don't need it now it is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; great feature to have since video calls are getting popular it would really
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enhance x2go usage further.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We do have a request for &quot;intelligent media transportation&quot; development.
</I>&gt;<i> We do have an exact plan to integrate this, but what I don't know is, if
</I>&gt;<i> the customer will pay for it. A further question is, wether the result
</I>&gt;<i> can be released as part of x2go, because the code will go to the owner.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe there will be a possibility to develop this part as a sponsored
</I>&gt;<i> feature too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But first we'll have to finish our work on the new release. As Linuxtag
</I>&gt;<i> is approaching fast, we needed to spend time on our booth and the things
</I>&gt;<i> we'll show. We'll be able to show every feature of the new release (even
</I>&gt;<i> the plasmoid), but we'll not be able to do the packaging in the last day
</I>&gt;<i> before Linuxtag - sorry. But after Linuxtag has ended this will be the
</I>&gt;<i> next task after making the new release accessible via git.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The next feature after the new release is published will be as described
</I>&gt;<i> before the USB portable Windows Client.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After that we'll discuss the &quot;intelligent media transportation&quot;. Our
</I>&gt;<i> Plan is to have XV Channel which will transport the Output to the Client
</I>&gt;<i> where it should be rendered. This can be used by every media player
</I>&gt;<i> which can use the XV extension.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've almost finished the work on the wiki so with the new release we'll
</I>&gt;<i> make some changes to the website. I've choosen &quot;dokuwiki&quot; as it is just
</I>&gt;<i> doing what it should do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> see you on Linuxtag,
</I>&lt;snip&gt;
We don't have a lot to contribute financially but we can probably
contribute something to this effort if it will help make it generally
available. I don't know if others are in a position to add the the kitty
