<PRE>Here's my 2c on this...

Neatx got released and basically went nowhere.  There hasn't been any new features developed just a few bug fixes and nothing recent.  And to boot, it's slow.
Freenx has all but died.  It has languished for a very long time.

So I don't see any reason to push anything toward those projects.

Hello x2go list,

I've added one of my not so important mail accounts to this list to share my opinion about nx based development in the future. I don't like mailing lists because they only collect spam (to add my opinion to a already discussed topic).
I've read some of the mesages here and I've taken a look to this project. I really don't think this is a good idea to work on a not compatible nx server. There are already enough free servers and clients in the world and we all should try to save a amount of compatibility to all projects.
There is also a plugin for mozilla (moznx) so you won't need to develop a own. 
Although i like the idea of the file transport and print module of x2go (pulseaudio too is already possible with opennx).
If you would change to python, i would help you to get things to work with neatx/freenx. Then you too would have no problem with the packaging, because everything you need is already done.
What do you think about at minimum getting those interesting features build up in external programms, so you can use it with all nx servers (or even vncs)?
