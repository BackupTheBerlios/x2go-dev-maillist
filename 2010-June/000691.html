<PRE>We get this problem quite a lot in our server racks using KVM switches where the keyboard will get out of sync with the desktop.  Some of the KVM's have you depress both Shift keys at the same time to toggle things back in sync.  Num Lock is a different story.  Sometimes you just have to quickly press it until it gets back in sync.  I mention this because this same type of problem appears to affect x2go as well from what you were saying.

Hello, all.  We have had numerous complaints about CAPS lock and NUM
lock getting out of sync between the physical and virtual desktops.  We
at first attributed it to accessing the same virtual desktop from
potentially different physical desktops.  Upon further investigation we
see the following:

When the lock is toggled from the virtual desktop, the change is
reflected on both virtual and physical desktops

When the lock is toggled from the physical desktop, the change is
reflected only in the physical desktop; it has no effect on the X2Go
session.  This puts the locks out of sync.  If the user then realizes
their lock is not on in the virtual desktop and then toggles it in their
virtual desktop, it also toggles in their physical desktop which now
keeps them out of sync.

I would imagine this is a challenging problem to solve but is it
possible for the X2Go client to detect a CAPS/NUM lock toggle even when
the X2Go desktop does not have focus and reflect that through to the
X2Go desktop session?
