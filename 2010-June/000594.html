Yes, I think I'm getting it.  So your application runs on a a Linux X2Go
Server.  The user clicks the icon on their desktop and launches an X2Go
Client which presents your application as a window on their physical
desktop.  You then want your application to be able to copy an excel
spreadsheet to the physical computer where it will automatically open
using whatever application on the physical computer is associated with
the mime-type.  Is that correct?

If so, I'd imagine there is a way but it might be a little tricky.  The
full client (as opposed to the Firefox plugin I've been testing) allows
one to automount local shares.  I suppose one could do this to a
consistent place (that might present some cross platform difficulties).
I'm not sure how one would automate the process of copying to that local
share mounted in /tmp/&lt;uid_media which is soft links to ~/media.  I'm
also not sure if there will be permissions issues trying to copy to the
physical computer unless the copy is done as the user.

I'm also not sure how one would get it to auto-open upon copy.  I
suppose one could write some sort of script to poll the directory where
the files are stored.  Certainly getting out of my depth now! Hope this
helps at least a little bit - John
