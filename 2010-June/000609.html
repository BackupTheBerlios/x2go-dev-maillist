Hi List,
&#160;

Well, actually it is not that difficult to export from the server to the client. In fact, as the user directory is mounted and the user is logged on to the server and is executing our system, it is quite easy. From our system we write the file to the mounted directory and voila it is on the client. No problems with authorization either, because the user himself is writing to the mounted directory.

&#160;

The next part is trickier. If we want to start the application on the client we should have a command in x2go so that it signals the x2goclient to start the specific file. So no polling, but simply an extra command that is called on the server and sends a message to the client. Now this means a change in the client, and a protocol for the message that is used. Furthermore a command on the server should be there to signal the start of the program on the client. This could be something like &quot;x2gorunclient path-to-the-file&quot;

&#160;

Added is a drawing of the different parts of the extension. I hope it clears any misunderstanding of what I want. The yellow marked boxes are to be changed, so the x2gorunclient command is to be created and the client has to be changed so it will understand the signal of the x2gorunclient command, interpret it and start the file.
&#160;

Cheers,

Dick

Yes, I think I'm getting it. &#160;So your application runs on a a Linux X2Go
Server. &#160;The user clicks the icon on their desktop and launches an X2Go
Client which presents your application as a window on their physical
desktop. &#160;You then want your application to be able to copy an excel
spreadsheet to the physical computer where it will automatically open
using whatever application on the physical computer is associated with
the mime-type. &#160;Is that correct?

If so, I'd imagine there is a way but it might be a little tricky. &#160;The
full client (as opposed to the Firefox plugin I've been testing) allows
one to automount local shares. &#160;I suppose one could do this to a
consistent place (that might present some cross platform difficulties).
I'm not sure how one would automate the process of copying to that local
share mounted in /tmp/&lt;uid_media which is soft links to ~/media. &#160;I'm
also not sure if there will be permissions issues trying to copy to the
physical computer unless the copy is done as the user.

I'm also not sure how one would get it to auto-open upon copy. &#160;I
suppose one could write some sort of script to poll the directory where
the files are stored. &#160;Certainly getting out of my depth now! Hope this
helps at least a little bit - John
