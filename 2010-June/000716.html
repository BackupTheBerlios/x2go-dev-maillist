Strange ideas do you have.

Why don't you use this?
<A HREF="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.linux.terminal-server.x2go.devel">http://news.gmane.org/gmane.linux.terminal-server.x2go.devel</A>

Or read this list as a usenet group. With both you can post too.

&gt;<i> I've read some of the mesages here and
</I>&gt;<i> I've taken a look to this project. I really don't think this is a
</I>&gt;<i> good idea to work on a not compatible nx server. There are already

</I>&gt;<i> save a amount of compatibility to all projects. 
</I>
You have a point, but I like the way how X2go works more. It's cleaner.
The way how Nomachine NX works is strange, and not really compatible
with how SSH works.

&gt;<i> There is also a
</I>&gt;<i> plugin for mozilla (moznx) so you won't need to develop a own. 
</I>&gt;<i> Although i like the idea of the file transport and print module of
</I>&gt;<i> x2go (pulseaudio too is already possible with opennx). 
</I>
I did not know about openNX. Interesting project.

&gt;<i> If you would
</I>&gt;<i> change to python, i would help you to get things to work with
</I>&gt;<i> neatx/freenx. Then you too would have no problem with the packaging,
</I>&gt;<i> because everything you need is already done. 
</I>
If everything is done, you don't need X2go!

&gt;<i> What do you think about
</I>&gt;<i> at minimum getting those interesting features build up in external
</I>&gt;<i> programms, so you can use it with all nx servers (or even vncs)?
</I>
A proxy would be nice, but not very important in my opinion. I think
it's not much work for other NX clients to support the X2go way.

You say &quot;all nx servers&quot;. In my opinion there is not even a good
alternative for an OSS NX server. Only FreeNX, but that seems to be
dead. And I have heard the new version of Nomachine NX will become
completely different...

With regards,
Paul van der Vlis.
