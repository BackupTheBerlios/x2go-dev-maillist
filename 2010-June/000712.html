There are already enough free servers and clients in the world and we all should try to save a amount of compatibility to all projects.

I can't speak for the developers but I think the goal is to develop
something broader than any of the NX projects.  I suppose it's a bit
like I've taken great open source projects like iptables, iproute2,
openswan, and openvpn and built a new project for a powerful network
security framework in the ISCS project (iscs.sourceforge.net).  So Heinz
and Oleksandr have taken the NX libraries, pulseaudio, sshfs, openldap,
etc., and combined them into a broader project.

We had originally planned to use NoMachine for our new company but were
frustrated with the sound problems.  We thought about starting a new
project to combine technologies including NX to do what we needed to do
but that's when we stumbled across X2Go.  We haven't looked back.

I think the lack of compatibility is not about isolationism but simply
because the goals of the project are bigger than simply an NX
client/server.  At least that's my take - John
