</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also in there is a link to tuning network performance too just wanted

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is the standard network performance tuning found everywhere. This is

</I>I have been wondering if it will help with resilience.  We are having
problems where, if the Internet connection starts dropping packets,
recovery of the X2Go client is much slower than recovery of other
applications such as web browsing.  We have tried playing with
ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax but that has not helped.
Has anyone else been able to make X2Go session more robust across poor
quality connections? Thanks - John
