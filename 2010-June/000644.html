<PRE>Hi Paul - hello *@x2go-dev,

Again we had some things to do this week. We've changed the plugin - for
everybody using/playing with it: please download the new one:

<A HREF="http://plugin.x2go.org">http://plugin.x2go.org</A>

There are now three more options supported by the *.x2go file:

showtoolbar=true

This sets the visibility of the x2goplugin toolbar to &quot;hidden&quot; (not
&quot;compressed&quot;) so it will be not possible to see or use it.


showstatusbar=true

This sets the visibility of the x2goplugin statusbar to &quot;hidden&quot; (not
&quot;compressed&quot;) so it will be not possible to see it.

At the end of the file you can now attach a ssh key as &quot;autologin&quot;
feature. Please be carefull with this option and use it only in secure
networks (as this would also allow to login to the machine for real!!!):

-----BEGIN DSA PRIVATE KEY-----
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
-----END DSA PRIVATE KEY-----

The site <A HREF="http://plugin.x2go.org/">http://plugin.x2go.org/</A> will change a lot in the next days. For
everybody who want's to use our scripts and css (because we'll provide
localisation and some more features):

The current files will be found inside the <A HREF="http://plugin.x2go.org/lib/">http://plugin.x2go.org/lib/</A>
directory, which is an link to the current version. We'll also provide
static version numbers like <A HREF="http://plugin.x2go.org/lib-0.1/">http://plugin.x2go.org/lib-0.1/</A> . Again: at
the moment this part is under heavy development and may still change (a
lot).

&gt;<i> I see something here: <A HREF="https://git.x2go.org">https://git.x2go.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure it works, I don't have a username/password...
</I>
The git is not up at the moment. But it'll soon - sorry for now...

There are some minor issues left we found during packaging (ldaps has
changed in squezze,...), but we are almost trough...

best regards,

Alex &amp; Heinz
