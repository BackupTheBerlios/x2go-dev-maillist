Thanks for your statement.

I too personally was rather sad to find out that freenx upstream was  
without future...

I then was happy to see that launchpad nx people changed to neatx...  
Enthusiastically, I installed it right away, faced my first dependency  
problems (that is Ubuntu / Launchpad) etc.

My 6 week experience with neatx is very frustrating, unfortunately. It  
crashes unpredictably during login process, only a couple of session  
logins are successful, session resume does neither work reliably...

I then remembered a magazine article about x2go and tried that. And I  
must say, if you want to use it as normal remote desktop software, it  
is the most reliable NX derivative I have met, so far. The current  
stable release and probably also some future versions will still/ever  
need work, of course - as any opensource project, but the approach  
already works convincingly.

AND MAIN POINT: x2go is no NX server/client software... It is a  
concept to setup a whole company network based on server based  
computing (SBC) and thin client technology, that also utilize slim  
transport features of the NX protocol. The session management is  
(becoming) far more elaborate and comprehensive than normal NX  
server/client applications target at.

You can also take a look at a project that utilizes x2go and creates a  
greater virtualization context around it: <A HREF="http://www.osbd.eu.">http://www.osbd.eu.</A>

Usability counts.

Thanks for you time,
Mike

PS: I personally like Python quite well, too. If you can code Python,  
Perl is not that difficult to learn. BTW: Perl with Python's code  
indentation style improves readability of Perl scripts...
