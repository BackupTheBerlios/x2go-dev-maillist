<PRE>Hi there,

after havine played with x2goserver-one/sqlite for a while I am  
testing x2goserver with LDAP/Postgres setup.

The Postgres setup was easy, thanks to the wiki (there are some  
essential typos in the wiki page, I have registered with the wiki to  
fix them).

But LDAP...

My very first impression is - and maybe I am wrong - that the  
LDAP-Server setup is far to rigid (I will speak openly).

I use x2go over the internet, thus every connection I make has to be  
encrypted and needs authentication.


1. LDAPS support
the x2goclient does not support LDAPS... Does it support StartTLS  
somewhere hidden in its guts? Otherwise, LDAPS is definitely an item  
for the x2go wishlist


2. LDAP Auth
the x2goclient does not support LDAP auth. At least simple_bind_s  
should be possible... -&gt; wishlist. When exactly does the x2goclient  
access the LDAP db? I suppose before authentication to one of the  
x2goservers. I wonder, if LDAP access was possible to also tunnel LDAP  
access through ssh... (i.e. after session login).


3. Documentation of Internas
The LDAP scripts in the x2goldaptools package help to setup an LDAP  
server from scratch. This is not what people might want if they  
migrate a site. For site migration to x2go without help of your setup  
scripts the internas of the LDAP communication/data storage methods  
must be documented better (e.g. difference between server and host in  
LDAP -&gt; serial = 1, scratchscratch...).


4. Admin DN...
The migration/setup scripts pre-requisite cn=ldapadmin,$BASE as admin  
DN. This is too rigid! There is a config file for LDAP settings  
(/etc/x2go/x2goldaptools.conf). This one should be used for putting  
information on the LDAP database.


5. Admin DN secret...
The migration tools take the LDAP admin password from  
/etc/libnss_ldap.secret. Also the ldap secret should be retrieved from  
/etc/x2go/x2goldaptools.conf, or even better from a  
/etc/x2go/x2goldaptools.secret file (0600:root:root). It might well be  
that people setup a special x2goadmin account in LDAP for the purpose  
of administrating x2go relevant LDAP-objects.


6. LDAP storage structures
Really big organizations group there LDAP data into ous. One ou for  
one department at work (e.g. ou=sales,$BASE; ou=management,$BASE;  
etc.). Within these ous they store sub-ous like group, people, hosts  
etc. Sometimes they even have ou based Administrators.

   cn=admin,ou=sales,$BASE
   ou=people,ou=sales,$BASE
   ou=group,ou=sales,$BASE
   ou=hosts,ou=sales,$BASE

   cn=admin,ou=support,$BASE
   ou=people,ou=support,$BASE
   ou=group,ou=support,$BASE
   ou=hosts,ou=support,$BASE

   ...

This is an approach the system and user management software GOsa&#178;  
goes, also AD structures often look like this.

I wonder if x2go is flexible enough to handle structures like these...


7. Active Directory
This might be overkill now, but has anyone tried to store x2go users,  
hosts and groups in AD??? With support of winbind, maybe?


8. Why LDAP?
Could anyone explain me, what x2go explicitly needs LDAP for? What  
information is stored in LDAP that could not be replaced by any other  
libnss services. (Has anyone ever thought to use netgroups and  
pam_access for machine access control, BTW?).


9. Load-Balancing
Could also anyone hint to me, how load-balancing in multi-server setup  
works with x2go? I guess this question is related to LDAP...


Loads of questions, sorry, but I couldn't get LDAP functionality  
running out of the box with my already existing LDAP setup.

Thanks a lot to whoever replies here!!!
Mike
