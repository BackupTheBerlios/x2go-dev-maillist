It's far from the most important feature, imho. It'd be nice to have,
I guess, but if you compare it to the possibility of using a scanner
connected to the client, then that's far more important. But anyway...
It's on Nomachines roadmap for 4.0, iirc, and I think that's the way
forward if any.

However, in some situations, you can probably fake it. If you run
gnome-panel with an upper panel from the terminal server and a lower
panel from the client, then you get sort of a &quot;mixed-mode&quot;. If you
then have a launcher for firefox and totem on the lower panel and
remove it from the upper panel, then it will feel very natural to
launch them on the client while all other applications are run from
the ts. The settings and history will be stored on the client, of
course, but you might be able to fake that as well, using some sort of
synchronization. If you click on URLs in other applications, then
you'll still launch the application on the ts instead of the client,
but you could probably setup a redirect somehow. If you make a script
that takes Firefox' parameters and save them to a file which the
client polls, for instance and then fire up Firefox on the client
using the same parameters.

I realize it's not exactly what you asked for, but it might be a good
workaround for the time being.

Anyway, I hope it helps you.
