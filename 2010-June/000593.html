The fact that both are broken helps narrow it down.  Both use fuse and
an sshfs mount to pass data.  Do you have fuse and sshfs installed? Is
sshd running on BOTH client and server? Are the users members of the
fuse group to have access to the fuse device? Those are the areas I'd
suggest checking.  Good luck - John
