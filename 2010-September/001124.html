</I>&gt;<i> It's easy and we don't need to pay for it! ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Could you please write down your ideas, on what branches you want to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; create and how you want to import the &#8220;latest sources&#8221;. Will you just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; take the latest tarballs or also the one beforehand?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My plan was to setup v. simple master and staging branches.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Master would contain the code as of today (which I believe to be stable)
</I>&gt;<i> and staging would be a fork of this code to which people would be able
</I>&gt;<i> to commit.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If someone wants to contribute a patch, how would she/he do this? Send
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the patch to the list and when it is acknowledged by anyone, you will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; push it? Or is there an &#8220;incoming&#8221; branch where all patches can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pushed to and some people are cherry-picking those to a development
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; branch? Sorry for all these questions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If people have an account on GitHub, they can clone the repo into their
</I>&gt;<i> own account, work on it and submit a pull request to pull the code back
</I>&gt;<i> into the main staging branch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This could then be reviewed by the project leaders and merged where
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate into the 'master' branch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Master would then be used to generate all debs/rpms/tar.gz/($other)
</I>&gt;<i> files for distribution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would suggest to wait until Monday evening, so people can read up on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this list when they get back to work and have time to respond. But if it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is not too much work for you and changes are possible, you could also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; set it up right away and people could comment on that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Reading the other threads, I am happy to wait until monday (or even
</I>&gt;<i> until after the release of Baikal!) before I do anything - whilst I am
</I>&gt;<i> happy to help out the community (and hopefully take some of the weight
</I>&gt;<i> away from the devs!) I don't want to cause any more upset than there has
</I>&gt;<i> been already!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Matt
</I>&lt;snip&gt;
Your positive, tangible steps to help are greatly appreciated.  I have
not used GIT but it sounds like you have proposed a flexible, usable
solution.  I have no problems with your running with (and no authority
to tell you to do so :-)  ).  Thanks - John
