Sorry Paul, but unfortunately you understand is wrong.

1. We didn't EVER violate GPL. All our sources independent of it release
or testing version are accessible over our website www.x2go.org. The
location of it is NOT HIDDEN. There is &quot;source code link&quot; on left side
of our main page with url of source and binary location:
<A HREF="http://x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/">http://x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/</A>
ALL our work is there, not only stable (pool-lenny) or testing
(pool-heuler) versions. Although in mailing list wrote Heinz the
location of this packages:
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/x2go-dev/2010-July/000768.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/x2go-dev/2010-July/000768.html</A>
How can we make access to our sources more easier???? But even after the
response of one of mailinglist users with direct link on tarball with
sources:
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/x2go-dev/2010-September/001040.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/x2go-dev/2010-September/001040.html</A>
even after my direct response:
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/x2go-dev/2010-September/001058.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/x2go-dev/2010-September/001058.html</A>
The mail-terror &quot;[X2go-dev] GPL violations&quot; has proceed.

2. GIT. We contribute our sources in tarballs, the same way as Debian
do. You can easily download all sources. In every tarball there is file
&quot;changelog&quot;, so you can see in which version which changes are made and
backup to previous version. I realize, that GIT is more easy to use for
most of users and we promise to install GIT. But ONLY after release of
Baikal. Yes, we had planes to release this version in April. Yes, we
didn't made it. But we working VERY HARD to release it as soon as
possible. Many projects in Open Source and although in commercial world
have the same problems. I can only ask you to wait some time and not to
cry every five minute: &quot;you have promised to install GIT in July&quot;, &quot;you
always say, you'll install GIT soon...&quot;. Yes, we will install GIT soon.
We will install it just after Baikal will released. And we want to
release Baikal as soon as possible. But now I must write the mails like
this instead of working on it. We WILL NOT install GIT before Baikal is
released, independent of how many time - 5 min, or 5 days we need to do
it. We have reasons. I will not describe them, this mail is already way
to long. But you can although download tarballs with source code instead
of check out GIT.

3. We appreciative accepting any help of community - critics, bug
reports, donations, features requests. If you'll download latest tarball
with sources, you'll find a bug in it and you'll send a patch with
bugfix - we will be very glad to apply your patch and specify in source
code and changelog that this bug was fixed by you. If you will send us a
patch with new cool feature, which will be found useful by other x2go
users (and us although) not only for you but for all x2go users, we will
be happy to include it in the next release. And you can make those
patches without GIT to.

4. We are very happy, that many people use our product in commercial
purposes. Our target is to make the best TS product on market. We are
very glad if other people modifying x2go to use it in their environment
and making this changes accessible for others. How did it for example
John with his modifications to fit x2go in VM environment. And many
other people do. We also try to help those people with all that we can
do, because it exact that way that Open Source work. What I can not
understand, that someone use our work and do all what he can do to
disturb developing of our project with argumentation that &quot;he is
fighting for his rights&quot;  (see 1.) And write many mails which discarding
our project. And many mails (although personal and the personal mails
was awful) in which he say that he want drag us into court because we
are violating GPL, even though that ideas of Free Software is for us
much more as only the way how we working.
But because of this one person we have interrupted to develop x2go,
cause both of us had two sleepless nights thinking how can we protect us
legally and how can we not let this person to discard us and our project
in eyes of our users, friends and community.


yours sincerely,

&gt;<i> Although I do not agree with J&#246;rg getting personal I, like others, can
</I>&gt;<i> understand the frustration of J&#246;rg and probably his last message with
</I>&gt;<i> the legal threats (thread GPL violations) are his desperate effort to
</I>&gt;<i> change that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But Russ misses the point in my opinion. Apart from that commercial
</I>&gt;<i> interests are totally valid and a lot of people have already argued that
</I>&gt;<i> J&#246;rg&#8217;s point of view is legally totally correct, it is not clear for me
</I>&gt;<i> why Heinz and Oleksandr do not except any help. They stated several
</I>&gt;<i> times, that they are short in time. But they did not accept any help
</I>&gt;<i> offer by J&#246;rg for example.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my opinion it is unfair and misleading to the community, because
</I>&gt;<i> people do plan their road map according to those statements. I do not
</I>&gt;<i> know the reason. But if Heinz and Oleksandr are afraid that they could
</I>&gt;<i> loose control over the project or do not want to share the burden, they
</I>&gt;<i> should state it clearly and people can draw their own conclusions from
</I>&gt;<i> their on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I definitely hope that this thread is not going to be any longer until
</I>&gt;<i> Heinz is back from vacation. I do thank Heinz and Oleksandr for their
</I>&gt;<i> work and support and I do hope that the X2go &#8220;community&#8221; will settle
</I>&gt;<i> this argument and will work together in the future as stated in several
</I>&gt;<i> messages to the list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Heinz and Oleksandr, if you need help with those legal issues I guess
</I>&gt;<i> there are a lot of people out here who can give you advise and support
</I>&gt;<i> you. Just publish that letter from that other company and go open with
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
