<PRE>I just wan't to be fair comment the things that going on here. 

Dear project,

whats going on here is business strategy. Somebody wants to earn money or wants to have good reputation and needs influence on the tool he is using - at best not influence but control. 
This is needed to proof customers or what ever you address that you are the only competence.
It is always esier to show the world failures of people, but in this way it was showing failures AND developing something better.
I too wanted to get control here and I've began to work on my own fork. And I've caused trouble to existing project.

I bet this project is dead even if you don't know now. The failures of the project was: No awareness of trademarks, no awareness of fast reacting and wrong marketing. If you want to keep control you should develop such things as company - not as project.

To give you a last chance - you can keep your little domain. It will be wanted soon by sombody else - so make your homework... ...this time...

Congratulations to the new way - I bet with contributions a fork will grow faster and better.

Here my thoughts about how this would be better:

* Don't spend time on own clients - integrate your work into existing clients like krd, tsclient, vinagre,...
* Have every functionality as a module so that somebody can use SMB and others SSHFS or WEBDAV
* As Plugin you should only make a google native client project. This is much better than every Plugin and Googles Browser even runs on phones - and you don't even need to compile it especially. I bet this can be soon done with python too.
* Face the future - there will only be google and ubuntu - javacript and python.

Your work is to be compared with spice and nx4!!!

so long...
