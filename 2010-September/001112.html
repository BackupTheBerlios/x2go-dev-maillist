<PRE>Oleksandr,

if I download a tarball every night and put it into some git repository,
the whole thing is useless.

How do you expect us to work with code and track bugs if we do not have
a source tree with concrete revisions?

You have never worked with VCS, have you? I have the impression that you
don't really have any experience with developing a project in a
community.

Even though debian publishes tar.gz as well, they definitely have VCS
respositories (a friend of mine is Debian developer) - because else it
would almost IMPOSSIBLE to track issues and contribute.

But I am really tired of explaining that again and again. You don't see
the advantage or you don't want to see it. As I said, I could setup a
git and download your tar.gz files every night (I cannot do more than
that I'm afraid) to import the stuff, but it would probably be quite
useless.

&quot;Hey devs, I want to file a bug I found in x2golistsessions in the
tar.gz I downloaded on July 12th, 12:34 UTC.&quot; *haha* That will be the
kind of bug reports I can give you. Doesn't make sense, does it?

You have decided to go on with a close development and we probably have
no other chance than accepting it.

It's sad that we have all this trouble and so much ideas and innovation
and energy gets lost because you cannot take those two minutes to get
your stuff (and commit history!) into a repo as paul suggested.

You have wasted hours of my time and made me frustrated as hell just
because you aren't able to hold your promise and do us all a favor that
takes you only 5 minutes. If I'd only have a small chance to do it
myself...but I haven't. We are all asking for a small thing that could
make a big improvement for all of us, but please understand that even if
somebody else setups the repository, you'd still have to contribute and
give him a snapshot of the dev branch with the history of commits.

I am moving on to some other project, I have done all I could do for
you. And I am out of energy.

J&#246;rg
