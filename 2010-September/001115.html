<PRE>A publicly accessible VCS is necessary in order to collaborate on any 
open source project.

I think what Alex and Heinz would like is to be able to do is somehow be 
able to separate their code from community contributions.  Perhaps they 
think that they would be able to market just their 'devs' code in some 
way.  But with the x2go foundation being already built upon GPL NX 
libraries I can tell you that this is not possible.  ALL x2go code to 
date is fully GPL and always will be.  There is absolutely no advantage 
to separate code or two VCS's or anything like this.

What is needed is for the project to put up it's existing GIT repository 
and allow the community to make contributions in some branches which can 
then be examined and tested and merged or rebased into the HEAD.  This 
way contributors can work on various pieces and when they have something 
good they can propose it for merging and invite other community members 
to test their work.

In all this the 'devs', Alex and Heinz, act as the 'editors' and 
evaluate the pieces with regards to the overall direction of the project 
and its architecture.  There is no advantage to waiting on any of this 
and putting up the repository should take just a matter of minutes and I 
think Alex and Heinz should not be afraid to share the source 
repository.  They retain the merge rights and so still have control.  
And then they can add others with merge rights as the project moves forward.

Regards,
Gerry
