Actually, we do see a need.  When replacing physical desktops with
virtual ones, users don't relish jumping back and forth.  Being able to
do all things from one desktop is important from a user perspective.

We are also seeing video becoming more important in educational
settings.  X2Go seems ideal for schools but a frequent stumbling block
in our presentations to date has been handling video.

The actual video handling libraries seem to be out of scope of X2Go as
it just uses the NX libraries but is anyone familiar with HP's RGS
(<A HREF="http://h20331.www2.hp.com/hpsub/cache/286504-0-0-225-121.html">http://h20331.www2.hp.com/hpsub/cache/286504-0-0-225-121.html</A>)? It
seems to vary the compression method used based upon what it is
transmitting thus it handles video differently from, say, text.  I have
never used it and have no idea how it works but, unlike SPICE, it is
being presented as a WAN friendly protocol.  Thanks - John
