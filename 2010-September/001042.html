</I>&gt;<i> But that's alright - we don't have to have git. But we HAVE to follow
</I>&gt;<i> legal requirements in the GPL. And not next year, but NOW!

Hello, Joerg.  I've listened to you very patiently on this list for a
while now because you do contribute and help and you are correct about
the GPL. I, too, am frustrated about the lack of access to all the
source and the difficulty in finding the source that is available
(although less so than you because I have not had the time that I wish I
had to look into the sources and contribute more).

However, I believe you are seriously misreading Heinz (with whom I have
now worked for a couple of years) and Oleksandr.  Yes, they should (make
that &quot;must&quot;) publish the code but I also realize they are two honest and
sincere fellows with full time jobs outside of X2Go who have given us an
enormous project with no significant financial backing of which I'm
aware.  Sometimes there are just not enough hours in the day (week,
month) to get it all done.  Perhaps we may disagree with their
priorities but let's not think there is some malicious, hidden agenda.
Receiving such emails probably does more to make them wonder why they
ever launched this project than it does to help the situation.

I am painfully familiar with being a completely overwhelmed open source
maintainer.  Sometimes there is not even enough time to enable
volunteers who are willing to help (set up git, wiki, code, etc.) to
help.  It can just feel completely overwhelming.  So let's please
contribute, guide, even positively correct but let's not jump up and
down on the dev's heads. That doesn't help at all.  I'm am sincerely
grateful for what Heinz and Oleksandr have done despite my concerns
which are very close to yours.  Peace - John

PS - regarding the plugin specifically, I believe they have made it
clear that the plugin is NOT released.  They have kindly responded to
requests for access to the plugin by list members by making it
available.  Perhaps now they wish they had not been so kind and kept it
under wraps until it was ready for release including source.
