<PRE>Hej Jarle,

I am not really a MAC expert - but I'd say if other X clients can
connect through UNIX sockets, the x2goclient should be able to do that
as well. When developing my python x2go library, I ran into pretty much
the same issue with win32 - nxproxy didn't really want to use unix
sockets in the cygwin environment. 
It might be that this is actually not a mac/cygwin problem, but that
there is something wrong with nxproxy, which is the component that gets
a compressed stream through SSH, builds a cache and plays back the
uncompressed X11 messages to the local X server.
Even though I cannot really help you, I have some ideas how you could
track down the issue: You have probably heard of nomachine.com who
actually invented the NX stuff. Go to their website and download their
NX Client for Mac OS X and see if that needs you to open the TCP X11
port or not It's using nxproxy as well (maybe even exactly the same
version/binary) - so the communication between X and the proxy follows
the same scheme as x2go does. The NoMachine website has a &quot;TestDrive&quot;
section that you can use to play around with - no need to setup an NX
test server!

I hope that will get you a bit closer to the solution what's going
wrong ;)

Good luck!

J&#246;rg
