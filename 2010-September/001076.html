<PRE>Hey Eli,

they will have to change the name/domain anyway!
The brand/name &quot;x2go&quot; is registered with DPMA (the German patent and
trademark registry institution) and is owned by &quot;sino
Aktiengesellschaft&quot; in D&#252;sseldorf. Well, and they would have to prove
that they have been using the &quot;x2go&quot; term before those guys - and they'd
have to do that before the opposition period has expired. 
As their responsiveness is very slow, they'll either miss the deadline
or they don't want to bother a lawyer again to get the forms correctly
filled out. :)

The failure of this project is that these guys do not think about the
consequences before they act and that they ignore efforts of people
willing to contribute unless they force them to justice court.

GIT was the &quot;next thing to do&quot; that was promised by mighty Heinz on July
15th - and I bet it won't be available before I have forked the server
side as well!

Instead of pushing the project into an open development to join the
forces (that's the only way to have success if you aren't a big
profitable company), they focus on QtBrowserPlugin? 

I heard NONE of the community members ever saying they don't like the
plugin as it is and it would be important to switch to QtBrowserPlugin.
Nice that you do it, but why don't u first do the important things that
are really needed?

J&#214;rg

</I>&gt;<i> Dear project,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> whats going on here is business strategy. Somebody wants to earn money or wants to have good reputation and needs influence on the tool he is using - at best not influence but control. 
</I>&gt;<i> This is needed to proof customers or what ever you address that you are the only competence.
</I>&gt;<i> It is always esier to show the world failures of people, but in this way it was showing failures AND developing something better.
</I>&gt;<i> I too wanted to get control here and I've began to work on my own fork. And I've caused trouble to existing project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I bet this project is dead even if you don't know now. The failures of the project was: No awareness of trademarks, no awareness of fast reacting and wrong marketing. If you want to keep control you should develop such things as company - not as project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To give you a last chance - you can keep your little domain. It will be wanted soon by sombody else - so make your homework... ...this time...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Congratulations to the new way - I bet with contributions a fork will grow faster and better.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here my thoughts about how this would be better:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Don't spend time on own clients - integrate your work into existing clients like krd, tsclient, vinagre,...
</I>&gt;<i> * Have every functionality as a module so that somebody can use SMB and others SSHFS or WEBDAV
</I>&gt;<i> * As Plugin you should only make a google native client project. This is much better than every Plugin and Googles Browser even runs on phones - and you don't even need to compile it especially. I bet this can be soon done with python too.
</I>&gt;<i> * Face the future - there will only be google and ubuntu - javacript and python.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your work is to be compared with spice and nx4!!!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> so long...
