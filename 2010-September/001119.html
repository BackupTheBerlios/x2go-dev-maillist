Please, all.  I think we've gotten our answers and we are just chewing
up a lot of time and burning up good will.  It seems to me:

1) There will be GIT from the devs after Baikal and not before.
2) We are free to set up a best effort GIT ourselves before then.

Those are the answers.  If we like them, let's run with them and get
back to work.  If we don't like them, and we've said we don't like them,
and said we don't like them, and said we don't like them, and said we
don't like them, and said we don't like them, and said we don't like
them, and said we don't like them, and said we don't like them, and said
we don't like them, and said we don't like them, and said we don't like
them, and those who hold the keys and contributed the original code are
not agreeing and not breaking the law, then please stop saying you don't
like them.

Can we stop now and get on with #1 and #2? Thanks - John
