<PRE>Hello List!

Unfortunately, I have wrote my last e-mail before I have seen all that
e-mails that J&#246;rg wrote. I don't want to excuse myself, but it is
ridiculous to say that we violating GPL! J&#246;rg, it is not my problem,
that you cannot read. Heinz have wrote on  09.07.2010 this E-Mail on
list(test version of baikal and some further informations):

-------------------
Hello x2gousers,

let's start this mail with the good news. After reading the next lines,
you'll be able to test the new features of our new release. You'll just
have to add the following line to your /etc/apt/sources.list:

deb <A HREF="http://x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/">http://x2go.obviously-nice.de/deb/</A> heuler main

Please don't remove the main x2go repository. After doing an apt-get
update you'll be able to access new versions of x2goclient, x2goserver
and the new packages x2godesktopsharing and x2goplasmoid. The new
packages are not yet named 3.1 (planned version number of baikal).
Little baby seals a called &quot;Heuler&quot; in german, so this is a preview and
not the new release. Please keep in mind, that there are still some
things need to be done before we can do the &quot;real&quot; release.

The new features/changelog:

x2goclient
old 3.01-5 new 3.01-11
New features:
  * plugin config options sound, exportfs, adsl, compression, quality,
dpi, kbdlayout, kbdtype
  * embeded mode for firefox plugin
  * updated interface
  * support for fs encodings
  * shadow sessions
  * xdmcp sessions
  * commandline option for printing in LDAP mode
-----------------------

We always put tarballs with sources in the same directory that binary
packages. ALWAYS. They WAS ALWAYS accessible by ALL people that want to
use it. The &quot;modified x2goclient's source which is used by mozilla
plugin&quot; exist only in your imagination.


Dear X2Go users.
We invest all our free time in X2Go. We doing all that we can do to
release new version as soon as possible. I have spent today more as two
hours to write this two e-mails, because English is not my native
language and it is not so easy for me. I could use this time to write a
lot of X2Go code. Please forgive us, that we can't answer all your
E-mails, but we reading all of them and we are very appreciative for all
your critics and wishes. As your see, we also trying to make them real
in our software. Please understand us, it is not easy to do all this
things at same time: write x2go, manage this project and do our regular
job. We have also friends and families. We want to make developing of
x2go our main occupation and we will thankfully accept all your patches.
But if we will starting to do this now, we would have no time to develop
X2Go any more.

And now I'll go to sleep 5 hours before I must be again in my office to
do my daily job.

Yours sincerely,
--
