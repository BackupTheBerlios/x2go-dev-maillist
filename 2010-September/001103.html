<PRE>Dear Heinz,

&gt;<i> Please have a look on the list again. There where Things to do first:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * recreation (vacation)
</I>
thank you for your response. I hope you could enjoy your vacation and
also relax a little to get new energy to do more great stuff.

&gt;<i> * protection of the project (more than one person claims the domain)
</I>&gt;<i> * protection of our reputation (let our attorney work on the acuses)
</I>
I am sorry that you have to deal with this unfortunate stuff.

&gt;<i> Again - the git repo is on our todo list. But all source code is and was
</I>&gt;<i> all the time published (as dh_make ready tarballs, which are still
</I>&gt;<i> wanted by other people).
</I>
Could I propose the following intermediate solution?

Could you let J&#246;rg (or someone else) set up the Git repository, so
people can base their patches on their and publish their own branches.

1. I am sure that the person hosting this branch can display a message
in the description stating that this is an intermediate solution. So
when you are done setting up your Git server or the solution to your
liking things can be moved and the location of the &#8220;master&#8221; Git
repository be documented.

2. I guess, you have some branches in your repository you do not want to
publish. And maybe you also want to go over the history if there are
confidential things in there. If so, I am sure there is a way to just
publish your &#8220;public branch&#8221;. I would propose the following but I am
sure there are better or more convenient ways.

        $ cd /tmp/
        $ git clone /path/to/your/project
        $ cd name-of-cloned-project
        $ git branch -a
        $ git branch -D names-of-branch-not-to-be-published # repeat as often as you need
        $ cd ..
        $ 7z a -t7z -m0=lzma -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=32m -ms=on x2go-branch.7z name-of-cloned-project

Send that branch to the person you want to set up the Git repository.
You can also ask him to review the history first and to amend commits
which have inappropriate commit messages.

Or the other repository gets set up and you are asked to push the
appropriate branches there.

        $ git remote add intermediate &lt;URL&gt;
        $ git push intermediate local-to-be-published-branch-name:master

3. I guess for this intermediate time you could also state if you want
the Git administrator set up commit rights to a development or testing
branch. So people can push there changes to these branches to get them
tested. Later you can easily cherry pick the commits you want to have in
X2go for sure.

Sorry for this long message and for bothering you again. I hope this is
a good compromise. Probably it is better suited for a Wiki page, but I
hope everyone behaves and will keep this thread easily understandable.

If someone can think of a better proposal, please write it down and
Heinz and Oleksandr can choose what fits best for them, if they accept
this compromise.

Maybe volunteers for setting up and maintaining that intermediate
repository can state that again by answering to this message.


Thanks,

Paul
