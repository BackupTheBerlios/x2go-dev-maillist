<PRE>hi, 

yes, you are right that it is important to enforce the gpl and therefore 
that the sourcecode is made available.

BUT:

[ ] you are aware of that the plugin has not been released yet, that the 
binaries that actually are out are not a release and _not_ intended for a 
productive environment right now?

[ ] you are aware of that x2go drains loads of energy from the two with 
promoting the procect etc?

[ ] you are aware of that heinz has stated that he already is facing 
dificulties that make a lawyer necessary, time, nervers, money?

[ ] you give credid that this project is happening in spare time, that we 
get a great software for free? and there _is_ a life next to a pc. i am 
more than grateful that we do get such a great project, that they put this 
much effort and energy into x2go. i do want to honor it. 

[ ] you know that they are huge supportes of oss, gpl and the like, that 
they have released the source code to the released (!) components and i am 
100% sure that this will also happen to the new plugin ... once it has 
been released?

i am sorry, but even though i believe that you are right to ask for 
sourcecode, i firmly do believe that in this case you are going too far, 
hitting the very wrong people!
