<PRE>Hello list members,

After the latest developments on the list, we've received a lot of 
complaints about the how this list is being used. Tobias - a member of 
Linux4Afrika - offered his help to improve the communication of this 
project. Please have a look at www.linux4afrika.de. Linux4Afrika still 
offers the best x2go tutorials on the net. We also got help through Mike 
Gabriel (a member of the x2go-dev list -&gt; das-netzwerkteam.de ). Thank 
you very much!

 From now on we'll change some rules of communication on this project:

1. x2go-dev list
the x2go-dev list is reserved for all development topics. There will be 
no discussion on topics like &quot;organisational criticism&quot; or &quot;personal 
preferences&quot;.

2. x2go-user list
The x2go-user list is reserved for all user topics. Please also avoid 
topics like &quot;organisational criticism&quot; or &quot;personal preferences&quot;. On the 
x2go-user list people may ask their questions on setting up working x2go 
environments, share their problems when using the x2goclient etc.  This 
list will be co-moderated by Tobias.  Please use acurate mail subjects 
and don't discuss &quot;Off Topic&quot; .

3. x2go-announcements list
there will be a new group called &quot;x2go-announcements&quot; too. This group is 
READ ONLY. On this group announcements will be made. When ever it's 
possible we will connect the information with a DATE so you can use it 
for your concepts.  We will do our best to give you timelines and time 
frames whenever possible. If we realize that plans and actions get 
delayed, we will inform you as soon as we know about it, so that you can 
adopt your own schedules. We hope to meet your requirements with this 
change. Please, make sure that you subscribe to the x2go-announcements 
list to benefit from this.

4. the GIT repository

In the future we will change our workflow as follows. We (Alex and 
Heinz) will use an internal GIT repository for drafts, collecting new 
ideas, internal testing, etc. This will be our sandbox, we do not want 
to bother you with that.

We will also push our work to a public GIT repository in regular, 
sensible intervals. This will always be the latest functional x2go code 
available (HEAD).

This shall give the online community convenient access to our work. As 
some of you have suggested, we will fill the GIT master branch with the 
x2go core components. The community, however, will have access to custom 
GIT branches), to work on their own blend. This will enable us to 
cooperate and benefit from each others' work.

With the master branch of the public GIT repository, it might naturally 
occur that pushed code is not the most stable, sometimes not even in 
testing state. To give us all some orientation, we will mark stable 
revisions of the public GIT master branch by tagging versions that are 
ready for testing. All untagged revisions may probably fail in your 
setup and exist only for your insight.

The public GIT (in terms of hosting and servers) is to be located in 
Germany and our objective is that it will not offend German laws 
regarding privacy protection. Ideally this should be a neutral space, so 
it is not bound to any company/person. We personally prefer Berlios GIT, 
because many people working with x2go already are Berlios members. We 
will help to build up this public  GIT and it should be the only space 
where people can find contributions. (We rather ask you to join in on 
our Berlios GIT, than setting up a repository of your own). The GIT 
Feature of our Berlios is already activated.

It is planned to publish the GIT with the help of Mike Gabriel - who is 
indeed a great help and truly a member of our new &quot;internet related 
community&quot;.

x2go has 3 mayor user groups. This might not be clear to everyone.

The communication channels of the first two groups are personal contact, 
regular meetings, phone conferences, etc. and of course e-mail as well. 
Most of these people are listening to this list, only some of them are 
posting contributions from time to time. That is namely people around 
the Linux4Africa project and people around Skolelinux. Both groups have 
been using x2go intensively for quite a while and we are always keen on 
keeping x2go compatible to their setups and environments.

The newest and third community is the online community of x2go. Mostly 
people, we have never met and maybe will never meet in person. The 
individual demands of this group are much different from the first two 
groups. This group has very specific needs and we would like to take 
care of them.

Again I have to thank you (the community) for the idea of the groups and 
the GIT as it was taken out of the history of our mailing list.

The lists will be made available in the next days. As soon as the 
Berlios team has activate them, you are invited to subscribe.

Further announcements will be made on the regarding mailing list:
