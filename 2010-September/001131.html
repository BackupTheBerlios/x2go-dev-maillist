&gt;<i> Hello list members,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After the latest developments on the list, we've received a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> complaints about the how this list is being used. Tobias - a member of
</I>&gt;<i> Linux4Afrika - offered his help to improve the communication of this
</I>&gt;<i> project. Please have a look at www.linux4afrika.de. Linux4Afrika still
</I>&gt;<i> offers the best x2go tutorials on the net. We also got help through Mike
</I>&gt;<i> Gabriel (a member of the x2go-dev list -&gt; das-netzwerkteam.de ). Thank
</I>&gt;<i> you very much!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From now on we'll change some rules of communication on this project:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. x2go-dev list
</I>&gt;<i> the x2go-dev list is reserved for all development topics. There will be
</I>&gt;<i> no discussion on topics like &quot;organisational criticism&quot; or &quot;personal
</I>&gt;<i> preferences&quot;.
</I>
This is the excisting list, isn't it?

&gt;<i> 2. x2go-user list
</I>&gt;<i> The x2go-user list is reserved for all user topics. Please also avoid
</I>&gt;<i> topics like &quot;organisational criticism&quot; or &quot;personal preferences&quot;. On the
</I>&gt;<i> x2go-user list people may ask their questions on setting up working x2go
</I>&gt;<i> environments, share their problems when using the x2goclient etc.  This
</I>&gt;<i> list will be co-moderated by Tobias.  Please use acurate mail subjects
</I>&gt;<i> and don't discuss &quot;Off Topic&quot; .
</I>
I think it's important that X2go has a friendly community. The last time
I see some people here who are a bit less friendly, I don't like
subjects as &quot;hello dead project&quot; or people who cannot wait till
something is done.

Maybe it's good to have somebody who does something when people are
not-so-friendly, But not sure if that's what you mean with &quot;co-moderated&quot;.

&gt;<i> 3. x2go-announcements list
</I>&gt;<i> there will be a new group called &quot;x2go-announcements&quot; too. This group is
</I>&gt;<i> READ ONLY. On this group announcements will be made. When ever it's
</I>&gt;<i> possible we will connect the information with a DATE so you can use it
</I>&gt;<i> for your concepts.  We will do our best to give you timelines and time
</I>&gt;<i> frames whenever possible. If we realize that plans and actions get
</I>&gt;<i> delayed, we will inform you as soon as we know about it, so that you can
</I>&gt;<i> adopt your own schedules. We hope to meet your requirements with this
</I>&gt;<i> change. Please, make sure that you subscribe to the x2go-announcements
</I>&gt;<i> list to benefit from this.
</I>
When I were you, I would not set so many dates. Tell it when something
is ready ;-)   Planning software-projects is very difficult. But, for
some people it's good to have deadlines.

Don't you forget Gmane?

&gt;<i> 4. the GIT repository
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the future we will change our workflow as follows. We (Alex and
</I>&gt;<i> Heinz) will use an internal GIT repository for drafts, collecting new
</I>&gt;<i> ideas, internal testing, etc. This will be our sandbox, we do not want
</I>&gt;<i> to bother you with that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We will also push our work to a public GIT repository in regular,
</I>&gt;<i> sensible intervals. This will always be the latest functional x2go code
</I>&gt;<i> available (HEAD).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This shall give the online community convenient access to our work. As
</I>&gt;<i> some of you have suggested, we will fill the GIT master branch with the
</I>&gt;<i> x2go core components. The community, however, will have access to custom
</I>&gt;<i> GIT branches), to work on their own blend. This will enable us to
</I>&gt;<i> cooperate and benefit from each others' work.
</I>
Hmm, not sure how other teams do this. I think it would be more nice
when it would be possible to work directly in the public GIT and to make
packages and tarrballs when it's ready. I think it would be nice if the
devel-team would grow slowly from 2 to more people. But it takes time.

But I think maybe you want to develop sometimes for a paying customer
who wants to be the first with a feature, giving it a bit later to the
comunity. In such a case you need a private GIT.

It will not be easy to grow from a private project to something what's
bigger and more open. Maybe it's good to talk to somebody with more
expierence on that, maybe that person could also monitor the list and
the GIT to give you advice.
Sometimes you will have to say &quot;no&quot; to patches, and for some things you
even don't have the time to study it...

Thanks for all your work on X2go!


With regards,
Paul van der Vlis.
