<PRE>Hi there,

</I>
If that might be of any help I could offer an intermediate (or  
permanent?) subversion repository on:
<A HREF="http://svn.das-netzwerkteam.de/websvn">http://svn.das-netzwerkteam.de/websvn</A>

SVN users could continue using SVN, GIT/BZR users can choose their  
favourite VCS locally.

I've been following the heated discussion and had to my tongue not to  
contribute on the list... However, there are a few aspects I would  
like to add...

1.
Maybe asking the guy from gpl-violations.org for support and  
counselling might well be a good idea. As far as I have heard and read  
he is a very positive, good-willing and supportive man and maybe he  
can clarify the situation.

Normally, the attorneys from GPL-Violations support you in creating a  
project setup and workflow that is GPL conformant. As far as I heard,  
rather than pointing with the finger at you for your past issues and  
telling you what a bad guy you have been, they support you in getting  
things straight for the future. I do think this might be helpful, also  
in terms of project and developer reputation.

2.
A repository that contains the very latest code (i.e. esp. last  
night's coding of Alex and Heinz) should be the only usage scenario  
thinkable. This is what people you want to contribute are asking for  
(including me).

@Alex: it is not necessary to run a GIT (or similar product)  
repository just for your files under obviously-nice.de/deb. This the  
location people install their debian systems from. I recommend a plain  
apache for this purpose (as there currently is). Additionally it might  
be nice to have an archive for older packages or distros (but neither  
in form of a VCS repository). But may be I misunderstood you in one of  
your former postings where you mentioned the planned GIT on your server.

3.
Access control to a public X2go repository (using SVN terminology)...

o developers and contributors have an account
o Alex and Heinz work on /trunk (ideally 2-3 check-ins per week, only if there
   is some valuable code to check-in, of course)
o community can request branches under /branch and copy latest /trunk
   (not some old tar.gz) to their branch and do customization there
o Alex and Heinz can pick the good ideas and fixes from the branches and merge
   them into trunk

(In GIT terminology, replace /trunk with ,,master'' branch, rest ist  
the same.)

4.
Only last weekend I have started on implementing an ltsp-x2goclient  
(an x2goclient that plugins into LTSP). Unfortunately, I had used  
J&#246;rg's python implementation that ran into licensing troubles  
(<A HREF="http://github.com/joerg86/pyx2go">http://github.com/joerg86/pyx2go</A>) just today. As I plan to continue  
the work on the python based ltsp-x2goclient I will have to creatively  
rewrite what used to be called pyx2go. The result of this upcoming  
work will be a complete rewrite from scratch and it will be published  
under GPL (what a waste of time!!!!). It will neither be bound to a  
contractor or similar. Thus, people who started with pyx2go will soon  
have an alternative python module that will be fully compatible with  
the dead project pyx2go.


5.
For any form of conflict management, coaching, moderation within the  
project may I recommend a very competent and communicative woman to  
the X2go project, namely my love and partner and most valuable  
colleague and councellor. Please contact me privately for her contact  
data if there is any need in the project concerning  communication,  
conflict manament, personal coaching, moderation. The work she can  
offer can be done via phone or in person (however, not via mail...).

light+love,
Mike
