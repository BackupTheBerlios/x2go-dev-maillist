Although I do not agree with J&#246;rg getting personal I, like others, can
understand the frustration of J&#246;rg and probably his last message with
the legal threats (thread GPL violations) are his desperate effort to
change that.

But Russ misses the point in my opinion. Apart from that commercial
interests are totally valid and a lot of people have already argued that
J&#246;rg&#8217;s point of view is legally totally correct, it is not clear for me
why Heinz and Oleksandr do not except any help. They stated several
times, that they are short in time. But they did not accept any help
offer by J&#246;rg for example.

In my opinion it is unfair and misleading to the community, because
people do plan their road map according to those statements. I do not
know the reason. But if Heinz and Oleksandr are afraid that they could
loose control over the project or do not want to share the burden, they
should state it clearly and people can draw their own conclusions from
their on.

I definitely hope that this thread is not going to be any longer until
Heinz is back from vacation. I do thank Heinz and Oleksandr for their
work and support and I do hope that the X2go &#8220;community&#8221; will settle
this argument and will work together in the future as stated in several
messages to the list.

Heinz and Oleksandr, if you need help with those legal issues I guess
there are a lot of people out here who can give you advise and support
you. Just publish that letter from that other company and go open with
that.


Thanks,

Paul
