</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hello, all.  We've seen this bug rarely but enough to know that it is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; real bug and not just a coincidence. Here is the report from our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; internal trouble ticket.  Unfortunately, it smells like it might be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; something in the NX libraries:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The user called because she could not see her mouse cursor in her
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; virtual desktop.  It was visible in her physical desktop. As we later
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; observed, it was indeed present in the virtual desktop, e.g., if she
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; happened to stop the mouse over a file in Konqueror, it would display
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the thumbnail, but the mouse cursor was not visible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; We tried suspending and reconnecting; that did not work.  I could see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; where the mouse was supposed to be via my VNC session to her physical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; desktop so I tried to change the mouse cursor theme but that did not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; work (and required a restart of KDE).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Finally, before rebooting to try to re-establish the connection between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; her physical and virtual desktops to display the mouse cursor, we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; thought to suspend her X2Go session and then completely close her X2Go
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; client.  When she restarted the client and reconnected to her X2Go
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; session, the mouse had re-appeared.  We did not need to reboot the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; physical computer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We saw this again today for the same user.  Has anyone else experienced
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this? Thanks - John
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> We now have another user who experienced this twice today.  I'm willing
</I>&gt;<i> to put in the time to troubleshoot this but I'm not sure where to begin.
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas? Thanks - John
</I>&lt;snip&gt;
This is now happening many times a day and is causing quite an upset.  I
scoured the Internet for ideas and there seems to be lots of reports
about this on Debian and Ubuntu but no clear identification of the
problem or clear fixes.

I posted to the Debian mailing list assuming it is a Debian problem.
They recommended editing xorg.conf to add Option &quot;SWCursor&quot; &quot;yes&quot; to the
video driver.  That didn't help.  Using Ctl-Alt-D as someone else
suggested to recover the mouse did not help.  I'm not sure if NX and
X2Go are complicating the issue.  Has anyone else seen this? Has anyone
solved it? It is making the system approach unusable.  Thanks - John
