<PRE>Hello Richard,

&gt;<i> Hi x2go users/developers,

</I>&gt;<i> while reviewing x2go I've encountered issues which scared hell out of me.
</I>&gt;<i> The client seems to perform zero input validation. A rough server can

</I>&gt;<i> For example x2goSession ONMainWindow::getSessionFromString ( const

</I>&gt;<i> If a line from the server, does not enough &quot;|&quot; we end up with
</I>&gt;<i> out-of-bound array access.
</I>&gt;<i> The source is full with such issues.
</I>
You are right, it is possible, that X2Go Client can be crashed with the
wrong output from the server. This issue could (and should) be easily
fixed by replacing operator &quot;[n]&quot; with method &quot;value(n)&quot;. However, I
don't think, that this issue is so dramatic as you described it. Why
some one should open a SSH/X2GO connection to &quot;rough&quot; server? I didn't
see such use case yet, when an administrator of server want to crash the
client application on a machine of his user. If a user root on your
Linux system is not an evil person, who want crash the X2Go Client on
your desktop, you should not worry about this issue. But if you living
in the world of BOFH, please don't use the X2Go Client until this issue
will be fixed. I'll fix it very soon.

&gt;<i> Finally I've also looked at the server.
</I>&gt;<i> In short, the 90's called, they want their setuid bugs back.
</I>&gt;<i> x2gosqlitewrapper.c just wrong, anyone can make it executing whatever
</I>&gt;<i> binary he wants with higher privileges.
</I>
Sorry, I don't understand what are you talking about. I not found the
file &quot;x2gosqlitewrapper.c&quot; in the source tree of package &quot;x2go server&quot;.
If you found a security problem in the recent x2goserver code, please
open a bug report on bug tracker, describe the problem and show how it
can be used. In best case show an example of exploit and send a bug fix.
Saying &quot;it is just wrong, anyone can do something&quot; is just your opinion
without any arguments.


&gt;<i> But it's not only the code that worries me.
</I>&gt;<i> On Windows the client executes per default sshd and x11. Both are
</I>&gt;<i> listening on all available IP-Addresses.
</I>
Yes, this components are required by X2Go Client. This services are
configured by default to listen all IP-Adresses. It is possible to
configure them to listen for connections only on localhost, but I see it
just as &quot;nice to have&quot; feature. Starting this services is not creating
backdoor on the system, otherwise  most UNIX machines would be
backdoor'ed, because they running same services. Furthermore, SSHD used
by X2Go is running only with user privileges and opening an access for
only one user and only shortly for each SSHFS connection. The rest time
SSHD don't accept a SSH-connections. In addition, each Windows system
have a firewall that by default configured to drop incoming
TCP-connections. This make SSHD and X11 to be only accessible from
localhost.



&gt;<i> You silently install a user &quot;sshuser&quot; on Windows, which has the password
</I>&gt;<i> of the currently logged in Windows user and give
</I>&gt;<i> him a login shell.
</I>
This is so untrue! X2Go Client can not install users on Windows system.
To be able to do something like that, X2Go Client must have an
administrator privileges. All X2Go Client components running with user
privileges. A SSHD open SSH access for current user and this is required
for SSHFS, which used to export client directories to server. If you
don't trust your server, just don't export your directories. And you
should not do this, independent what kind of network FS are you using.
It is always possible, that untrusted server can manipulate your data or
credentials. It's impossible to open a SSH-Connection to your client
until you don't exporting directories to server.


&gt;<i> I haven't seen such a trainwreck of software for a long time.
</I>&gt;<i> By installing it on my system you've successfully backdoor'ed my clients
</I>&gt;<i> and the server.
</I>
I appreciated your criticism, but writing something like that in the ML
of a community project is just not respecting the work of people, who
spent a lot of their time and costs to develop something useful for others.
