No. The tone of your messages is bordering on insulting.  The fact that 
you claim you don't attack Alex personally doesn't make it any better, 
it's still inappropriate.
While I agree with you that Alex might not have grasped the severity of 
the issue in full, there is no need to come across like that.

&quot;But I am right!!11!!oneoneeleven!&quot; is no justification to forget your 
manners.

So, please keep it civil. We *are* interested in your *constructive* 
criticism.

I've had personal disagreements with Alex before (on- and off-list), but 
whenever he disagrees with me, I take it as a sign that *I* failed to 
explain myself properly, not as a sign that he is too dumb to understand 
or simply unwilling. Maybe you should try a similar approach.

Kind Regards,
Stefan
