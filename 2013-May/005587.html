<PRE>Hi Nable,

&gt;<i> &gt; system(&quot;mkdir -p $dir/.x2go&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> Are you sure that nothing will break if `$dir' contains space or some
</I>&gt;<i> other special^W sensitive characters? Of course, i understand that
</I>&gt;<i> using such characters in homedir path is a really bad idea but.. i
</I>&gt;<i> think apps must be secure by design.
</I>
Well, I don't mind fixing this to be safe with special chars ... ;) I however really doubt administrators to set homedirs to something with spaces or special chars.
 
&gt;<i> And second thing:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and is deeper than /home/$USER
</I>&gt;<i> I think that this comment is wrong. As I understand, it doesn't matter
</I>&gt;<i> how deep dir, what matters is whether user's homedir exits or not. And
</I>&gt;<i> if I've understood correctly (manual page for x2godbadmin is too
</I>&gt;<i> short, although comments in the program are rather good) x2godbadmin
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't create users, it only manages DB and creates ~/.x2go/ part if
</I>&gt;<i> it's missing.
</I>
Yes, true. It doesn't matter how deep it needs to be, however its a rather common case wanting to provide access to someone which does not have its homedir created yet.

&gt;<i> So, if user is present in system (getpwnam returns info about existing
</I>&gt;<i> users) but his homedir is missing I think that it's better to issue
</I>&gt;<i> some warning instead of silent homedir creation (at least because this
</I>&gt;<i> homedir won't contain files from /etc/skel, especially ~/.profile and
</I>&gt;<i> ~/.bashrc).
</I>
Well, I disagree. You would simply still not be able to login. I think either error or success is the way to go - I rather decided to use success for the sake of creating an empty home. At some point you are right, as you would automatically disable pam_mkhomedir as it would not complain a missing homedir - The practial downside is the missing skeleton copy at creation time.

Ideas?
