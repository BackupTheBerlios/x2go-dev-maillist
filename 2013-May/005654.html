X2Go Component: src:x2gobroker
Version: 0.0.2.1
Status: RELEASE
Date: Sun, 19 May 2013 12:41:06 +0200
Fixes: 201 210 211
Changes: 
 x2gobroker (0.0.2.1) RELEASED; urgency=low
 .
   [ Mike Gabriel ]
   * New upstream version (0.0.2.1):
     - Remove trailing slashes from ManagementServer URLs.
     - In Apache2 vhost configuration example, move WSGI environment
       variable settings into VirtualHost setup.
     - Remove unused, not-yet-developed broker backends and frontends.
     - Remove old cruft from x2gobroker.conf.
     - Security fix for setuid wrapper x2gobroker-agent.c. Hard-code path to
       x2gobroker-agent.pl during build via defining a macro in the Makefile.
       Thanks to Richard Weinberger for spotting this!!!
     - Handle URLs in plain WebUI that have slashes (and subpaths) in the
       backend name.
     - In WSGI mode: only populate os.environ with variables matching
       &#187;X2GOBROKER_*&#171;.
     - Make X2GOBROKER_SESSIONPROFILES configurable via a SetEnv WSGI parameter
       in the httpd configuration possible. (Fixes: #210).
   * Provide init scripts and *.default files outside of /debian folder (as
     they are also relevant for non-Debian packaging).
 .
   [ Jan Engelhardt ]
   * New upstream version (0.0.2.1):
     - Populate install target of Makefile. (Fixes: #201).
     - Install man pages and default files through Makefile, as well. (Fixes:
       #211).
</PRE>
