<PRE>Hi,

I would like to get the following functionality from X2go.

I would like to use a key press to toggle between the 'keyboard focus'. I
would press a key on the keyboard and the focus would toggle between the
client and the server. That way I could keep the keybindings the same for
both machines.

For example: I use i3wm on both machines. Windows key + fn key switches
workspaces on both machines. I would like to press a key to toggle the
focus between the client and server desktop.

So maybe I would press &quot; ` &quot; and it would set the focus to the server and
then all my subsequent key presses would affect the server desktop. When I
want to return to my client desktop I would press &quot; ` &quot; and it would set
the focus to the client.

I could change the keybindings for my window manager iteslf. In fact I may
go this route if there is no solution for x2go. However I thought it might
be easier to have a focus mechanisim in x2go.

Is this already a feature of x2go?  If so how do I implement it. Maybe I
could write something for the wiki.

If not, would it be difficult to enable such functionality?
