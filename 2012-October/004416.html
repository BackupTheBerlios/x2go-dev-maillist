<PRE>A new cairo &quot;stable&quot; release is out and it seems to trigger another bug
with NX. When I update the remote system to the new cairo release the
Xfce session gives lots of such errors:

The program 'xfce4-netload-plugin' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)'.
  (Details: serial 225 error_code 2 request_code 25 minor_code 0)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error()
function.) The program 'wrapper' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)'.
  (Details: serial 325 error_code 2 request_code 25 minor_code 0)

systemload-14 has been automatically restarted after crash. The program
'xfce4-mixer-plugin' received an X Window System error. This probably

...

All gtk windows seem to instantly crash. The panel and also the menu at
right click.

Any idea how to debug this? Do we need to build NX with debug symbols
or some gtk/Xfce packages?

PS: We don't seem to have a generic way in NX-libs to apply distro
C(XX)FLAGS. I see wild hacks all around. Any idea how to improve this?
