Hello Mike,

I've instaled OpenSuse 12.2 and everything with plasma is working fine.
No kwin crashes, resizing works as expected when resizing the windows live.

I haven't have time yet to test suspending with a different resolution in full 
screen mode and restoring with another one in full screen mode.

Little bit tired now.

I'm a debian/deb lover and for the sake of god hate rpm, but debian have some 
problems too, with some legacy stuff like libreoffice and those iceweasel and 
icedove freaks, Lol.

Will evaluate OpenSuse and try to migrate  my already done settings/kiosked 
interface/menus  from the kubuntu dev machine to OS.

regards,
