 &gt; It may be I am seeing similar crashes to you. When I said Xorg locked
 &gt; up, I only meant that nothing in my x2go session would respond (not
 &gt; only chromium, but all mouse clicks were ignored). It may very well be
 &gt; that VcXsrv on the client is crashing, since I was able to recover by
 &gt; quitting and restarting x2go. I think I may even have had to use
 &gt; Windows task manager to kill VcXsrv, but I don't remember (it has been
 &gt; a while since it last happened).

No, not the same, see below...

 &gt; I am using the Chromium x86_64 package from the Archlinux &quot;extra&quot;
 &gt; repository. Currently it is at version 21.0.1180.81-2.

Hmm.  Debian Wheezy has Chromium-Browser 20.0.1132.57.  I might try that 
soon.

 &gt; I never use proxy settings, so I was unsure what exactly you wanted me
 &gt; to test. I just accessed Chromium:
 &gt;
 &gt; Settings...Network...Change proxy settings...

Indeed that is what I meant, only that back when I last tried it, Chrome 
had an option like &quot;advanced settings&quot; that you had to click before the 
change proxy settings button becomes available.


 &gt; and I was shown this message in a new tab:
 &gt;
 &gt; &quot;When running Chromium under a supported desktop environment, the
 &gt; system proxy settings will be used. However, either your system is not
 &gt; supported or there was a problem launching your system configuration.
 &gt;
 &gt; But you can still configure via the command line. Please see man
 &gt; chromium for more information on flags and environment variables.&quot;

And this is the tab I only get to see after killing all x2go-related 
processes on the client and reconnecting, as in the very moment when I 
click the button, vcxsrv goes &quot;zap&quot; on me and dies with the error 
message shown in my message from back in May.

Well, since I have one box running Wheezy, I guess I'm going to give 
both the latest Chrome and Wheezy's Chromium-Browser a try soon.

Again, thanks for the information you gathered and shared.

-Stefan
