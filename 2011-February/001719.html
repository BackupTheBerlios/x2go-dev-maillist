Right now I'm working only with the browser-client.  I'm intentionally
crashing the browser and then trying to resume the detached session.  So
from the client perspective it's a whole new client process that doesn't
know anything about an existing tunnel.

What I'm thinking is that when this happens the server is not receiving
an ACK and is putting the connection into TIME_WAIT state whose interval
is defined as 2*MSL where MSL is the packet lifetime.  Most networks
have MSL set to 30 seconds these days.  I think it used to be 120
seconds.  So it looks like TIME_WAIT will last from 1 to 4 minutes
depending upon the server network.

So what happens is if the user just waits long enough then they can
resume the detached session.  If they keep trying at intervals less than
TIME_WAIT then it seems they never get reconnected.

I'm not sure what type of experiments need to be constructed to account
for all the scenarios that can happen between the different types of
clients and the server.  But we need to think about that.  And then see
if we can manually construct these scenarios just using terminals and
try to tweak the settings until we have good behavior under each
scenario.  Then try to determine how to get the client, nxproxy and the
server to implement those behaviors.


Regards,
Gerry
