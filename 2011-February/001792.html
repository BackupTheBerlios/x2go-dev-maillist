I don't remember if it was eyeos, but we looked at some of these &quot;web
desktop integration&quot; solutions a while back.

It's not the same experience as having a &quot;real&quot; desktop. 

Yes, they've managed to write some office-style apps and email clients
and other things. 

But that does not truly duplicate a bona-fide native desktop.

Many of the clients we pursue have very industry-specific software they
need to run. 
It needs to run the same whether we put it on their machines or ours in
the cloud. 

With good remote access there's no retraining of users because they are
using the same software they've been using for years.  Just accessing it
remotely.


In the end, we opted to not go the WDI approach and instead looked for
good remote access technologies such as x2go that gives us the
flexibility to offer nearly any type of local/remote/cloud solution for
the client.

Gerry
