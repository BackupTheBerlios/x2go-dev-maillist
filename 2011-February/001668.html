</I>&gt;&gt;<i> screen updates better.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Of course, the big question is what.  HP has done some very interesting

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> file to the physical desktop and playing it locally like Citrix does but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by adapting the algorithms used for transmitting the video.  I do not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> believe they have open sourced the code.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Almost two years ago, Heinz forwarded me a link to a University project
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that was investigating more video friendly remote video protocols.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, I don't have an answer but I think we can keep our eyes open for

And just to follow up on this, it cannot be forgotten that network
transparency has been a big part of the Unix/Linux experience is has
been available for so long that it is now taken for granted.

Wayland and the other display technologies that people are working on
are more structured around gaming and that &quot;smooth and fast&quot; experience
while ignoring the network transparency part of the Unix/Linux display
world.

It may be that we end up with a dual display technology approach.  X and
&quot;gamer GPU&quot; technologies.


Regards,
Gerry
