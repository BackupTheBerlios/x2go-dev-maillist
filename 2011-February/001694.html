</I>&gt;<i> That would be very appreciated.  I think the next step is already in
</I>&gt;<i> motion; Phil has contacted the vcxsrv devs with whom he seems to get on
</I>&gt;<i> well.  In the meantime, we can slot in the bits into the code to make it

</I>&gt;<i> regardless of whom we ultimately use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alex, we would actually prefer you do that as we truly are not
</I>&gt;<i> developers.  Do you have time for that portion, i.e., not fixing vcxsrv
</I>&gt;<i> but simply changing the X2Go Client code? If, not, we'll take our best
</I>&gt;<i> stab at it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Gerry, if we find the vcxsrv folks are not able to get to this right
</I>&gt;<i> away, do you have anyone with X skills who could troubleshoot and fix
</I>&gt;<i> it? That's way out of our league.  Thanks, all - John

John, if I did we'd have fixed it already. :-)

X is not within our skill sets.

General question, is it possible to build a debug version of X?  Can X
be run under the control of a debugger?  If so, maybe breakpoints could
be set until we narrowed down the section of code causing the problem or
maybe we could tell where it was from a core file.  Just some thoughts.

Regards,
Gerry
