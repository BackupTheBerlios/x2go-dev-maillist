</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Indeed, NX runs rings around RDP.  However, it fails miserably playing
remote video and consumes lots of CPU when doing large screen updates.
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, the big question is what.  HP has done some very interesting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; work with adaptive protocols, i.e., they adapt their compression
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; algorithms to the needs of the video transfer.  If I understand them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; correctly, they handle the streaming video problem not by spooling the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; file to the physical desktop and playing it locally like Citrix does but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; by adapting the algorithms used for transmitting the video.  I do not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; believe they have open sourced the code.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; Almost two years ago, Heinz forwarded me a link to a University project
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; that was investigating more video friendly remote video protocols.
</I>&lt;snip&gt;
&gt;<i> One promising development is SPICE <A HREF="http://spice-space.org/">http://spice-space.org/</A> resp.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/virtualization/rhev/desktop/spice/">http://www.redhat.com/virtualization/rhev/desktop/spice/</A> .
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>We looked at SPICE very seriously and are big RedHat fans however, at
last look, it was primarily a LAN protocol and did not work well on
lower bandwidth, WAN links.
&gt;<i> Another new development (though the FAQ says it's only tested on high
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth links) is xpra <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/partiwm/wiki/xpra">http://code.google.com/p/partiwm/wiki/xpra</A> .
</I>&gt;<i> There is even a GUI app around it, winswitch <A HREF="http://winswitch.org/">http://winswitch.org/</A> .
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I tried with some kind of success across an analog modem link years ago
</I>&gt;<i> was the Differential X Protocoll Compressor (dxpc)
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.vigor.nu/dxpc/">http://www.vigor.nu/dxpc/</A> .
</I>Just took a very quick look at this and it looks very interesting!
Thanks for digging it out - John
