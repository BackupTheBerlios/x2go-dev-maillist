First: the Git at code.x2go.org has so far not been officially  
announced on any channel. The main reason for this is (from my  
perspective) that I have had no definite confirmation from Heinz and  
Alex, yet, that they will really change over X2go development to a  
publically available Git based release model. From my point of view,  
there has been good will so far, but no definite: YES. That means:

   o upstream code is comitted into upstream Git and reflects the upstream
     development process (i.e. there are more commits than releases)
   o at some stages the upstream developers ask a release manager to tag a
     release
   o the release tagging informs distro packagers that there is a new upstream
     version of one of the X2go projects

The Git on code.x2go.org was already ,,nice'', but it's main flaw was  
the lack of history. Also: the lack of being able to extract the  
original tarball releases from the git directly. However, that shall  
be possible in the future.

In the run of meeting Heinz and Jonas in Zweibr&#252;cken and talking to  
Heinz on the phone later, a slightly different Git model has come up  
that I am preparing now for proposal.

I have asked Heinz and Alex internally for an opinion on the new  
model, but have not received a reply within the last week. I must  
confess that I explained the gains of the new structure only shorly

Thus my basic idea with the latest work on code.x2go.org was to show  
the new structure to the world and discuss the following advantages of  
upstream Git projects that:

  o contain a pristine-tar branch
  o contain a nearly complete history
    (that is as many of the older releases as possible) on the x2go-dev ML.
  o release numbers do not contain hyphens (''-'') anymore
  o all X2go projects have a a.b.c.d version number (major.minor.micro.nano(?))

Everything I do currently is reversible and in upstream we (Heinz,  
Alex, Mike) are still in the middle of a discussion process. There is  
not yet a consensus on how the Git will be used and there is no  
roadmap yet either. However, I urge everyone involved (and this not  
for the first time, but maybe the first time in public) to focus on  
that in the oncoming days and weeks before diving into new absorbing  
coding work. That is: I recommend to sharpen the tools first.

@Heinz+Alex: we have to get this to a definite state now. I feel  
myself getting gradually impatient about the sluggyness of this  
process. Please, contribute to this thread. My personal goal is that  
we have a definite result on X2go upstream git usage at the end of  
this discussion thread.

@Morty: thanks for re-addressing this topic!!!

Greets,
Mike
