<PRE>Per Wayland FAQ: Is Wayland network transparent / does it support remote
rendering? &lt;<A HREF="http://wayland.freedesktop.org/faq.html#heading_toc_j_8">http://wayland.freedesktop.org/faq.html#heading_toc_j_8</A>&gt;

No, that is outside the scope of Wayland. To support remote rendering you
need to define a rendering API, which is something I've been very careful to
avoid doing. The reason Wayland is so simple and feasible at all is that I'm
sidestepping this big task and pushing it to the clients. It's an
interesting challenge, a very big task and it's hard to get right, but
essentially orthogonal to what Wayland tries to acheive.

This doesn't mean that remote rendering won't be possible with Wayland, it
just means that you will have to put a remote rendering server on top of
Wayland. One such server could be the X.org server, but other options
include an RDP server, a VNC server or somebody could even invent their own
new remote rendering model. Which is a feature when you think about it;
layering X.org on top of Wayland has very little overhead, but the other
types of remote rendering servers no longer requires X.org, and
experimenting with new protocols is easier.

It is also possible to put a remoting protocol into a wayland compositor,
either a standalone remoting compositor or as a part of a full desktop
compositor. This will let us forward native Wayland applications. The
standalone compositor could let you log into a server and run an application
back on your desktop. Building the fowarding into the desktop compositor,
could let you export or share a window on the fly with a remote wayland
compositor, for example a friends desktop.
