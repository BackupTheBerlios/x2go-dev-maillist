<PRE>Hello, 
I'm would like to suggest something to complete the third solution.
Why don't we offer to the user the possibility to encode with a video
stream a particular window.
The server don't have to decide to encode or not.
You decide to encode only when it' absolutly necessary by a right click
on the window and finaly a choice in a menu.

regards,

c&#233;dric cavret

ps : sorry for my poor english. I just discovered x2go a couple of
months ago and i'm very insterested in it's developpement.
Thanks to the developpers for the great job.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; easier to post the content on a webserver that the users can access from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; their client machines.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;     
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; This is where I disagree.  When we have control of the content and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; environment that works.  But that's not our environment.  We want as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; seamless a user experience as possible whether they are browsing the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Internet and hit a video, clicking on an email attachment that happens
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; to be video, or viewing some kind of embedded video content.  We expect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; our clients to be able to work as closely as possible to their physical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; environment in their virtual environment.  The onus is on us to make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; that possible as transparently as possible without changing their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; procedures.  That may not be true of all deployments but it is true of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; ours - John
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Right now there is no simple way to do this with x2go or any of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; other remote access technologies.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Actually, although I have not used it, I believe Citrix is doing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something like this.  Whatever EyeOS is doing works very well.  HP is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; taking a different approach by adapting their transport to the nature of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the video being transmitted.  If what I propose is feasible, we have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible solution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are basically 2 solutions to this problem (actually 3):
</I>&gt;<i> - Adapt the software playing the media to stream the raw data over to
</I>&gt;<i>   the thin-client without reencoding and play that stream on the
</I>&gt;<i>   thin-client. Pros: same quality as local, Cons: possibly needs a lot
</I>&gt;<i>   of bandwith and processing power on the thin-client. Only works with
</I>&gt;<i>   adapted media-players.
</I>&gt;<i> - Adapt some video-API like XVideo to re-encode every video-stream its
</I>&gt;<i>   asked to play into some transfer format which is encodable in realtime
</I>&gt;<i>   and sufficiently small in bandwith usage. Pros: thin-clients may be
</I>&gt;<i>   smaller, works with every software that uses standard Video-APIs (so
</I>&gt;<i>   possibly not flash...), lower bandwith usage. Cons: Possibly wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i>   work with flash, needs a lot of processing power on the server,
</I>&gt;<i>   possibly too much for high quality or larger window sizes of the video
</I>&gt;<i> - Use some heuristics to recognize rapidly changing window contents
</I>&gt;<i>   (which probably is either video or a game). Encode that window content
</I>&gt;<i>   into a video stream. Pros: works with every software, including flash,
</I>&gt;<i>   games and other weird stuff (i guess there will be corner cases
</I>&gt;<i>   though). Cons: unbelievably ugly, lots of server load, possibly crappy
</I>&gt;<i>   quality.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; For true transparency the media would have to be played on the remote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; desktop media player but then the performance is bad.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; To get satisfactory performance you have to use the media players on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; users machine but then you would not have seamless experience.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is not entirely seamless but, at least for our purposes, it is much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; better than saying, &quot;save the video to disk, transfer the file to your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; local computer, now open it using your local media player.&quot; Let's do all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of that automatically for them.  That may not work well for your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; environment but it would for ours.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The approaches described above practically preclude any scenario where
</I>&gt;<i> playing videos would be absolutely seamless. Practically all solutions
</I>&gt;<i> that do not take the third approach do only work with a few media
</I>&gt;<i> players (in practice: their &quot;special&quot; Windows Media Player and their
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;special&quot; Flash). I could be wrong and there are better solutions out
</I>&gt;<i> there, but everything I have seen so far suggests that there is no nice
</I>&gt;<i> and easy way...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>
