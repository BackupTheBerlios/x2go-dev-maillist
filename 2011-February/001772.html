In what sense? That would only be a security hole if x2go were less
secure than simple ssh logins. If that is the case, those security
problems should of course be fixed. But I don't see the risk in allowing
x2go usage to users who can use ssh anyways.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;     
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, but in large setups, groups become very hard to manage. Large

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a large number of additional groups for each user tends to be

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, qualified sysadmins have been managing large installations quite

</I>
Yes, success comes from expirience and the right set of tools. And my
expirience tells me that groups are often not the ideal tool for the
job. Again, we wouldn't necessarily need to do away with the 'x2gousers'
group, we just would make the process more flexible to allow for
authorization mechanisms other than by group membership.

&gt;<i> &gt; And our approach wouldn't make the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'x2gousers' group go away if you still want to use it: You can simply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make the x2gowrapper executable only for that group and not for others.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then you have exactly the same functionality as with 'sudo', but without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the hassle of setting up the sudo configuration (wich does never seem to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work automatically on installation). That would also be the suggested
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; migration path i guess. Additionally you can of course use database
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; black/whitelists, or you can set x2gowrapper o+rx and only use database
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; black/whitelists. In that sense our approach would also be far more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; flexible than the current sudo approach.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't make the 'x2gousers' group go away.  But it removes all the
</I>&gt;<i> 'sudo' functionality which does it's job of auditing and control very well.
</I>
Adding appropriate syslog functionality to x2go could of course easily
be done. But the sudo-logspam x2go causes is in on way any viable means
of auditing and control, its much too easy to hide an attack in such a
huge amount of logged lines.

&gt;<i> I don't get what is complained about here:  sudo being difficult.  It is
</I>&gt;<i> not difficult at all.  Use 'visudo' as you should and it works very well.
</I>
Yes, but for example the debian package installation does not use
visudo, instead it just tries to edit the sudoers file to the best of
its abilities. Which, if the sudoers file has been altered before,
usually fails. That leads to frustrated first-time users and possibly
screwed up sudo configuration either by the script or the user, which
could be a huge security problem.

&gt;<i> If you try direct access to the sudoers file then you have to take extra
</I>&gt;<i> precautions.  If you're not doing that then of course you will run into
</I>&gt;<i> problems.
</I>
Which is, in other words, &quot;sudo configuration is fragile and difficult&quot;
;)



Ciao,
