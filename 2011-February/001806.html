</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;     
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This is where I disagree.  When we have control of the content and

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Internet and hit a video, clicking on an email attachment that happens
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to be video, or viewing some kind of embedded video content.  We expect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; our clients to be able to work as closely as possible to their physical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; environment in their virtual environment.  The onus is on us to make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that possible as transparently as possible without changing their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; procedures.  That may not be true of all deployments but it is true of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ours - John
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Right now there is no simple way to do this with x2go or any of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other remote access technologies.
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, although I have not used it, I believe Citrix is doing
</I>&gt;<i> something like this.  Whatever EyeOS is doing works very well.  HP is
</I>&gt;<i> taking a different approach by adapting their transport to the nature of
</I>&gt;<i> the video being transmitted.  If what I propose is feasible, we have a
</I>&gt;<i> possible solution.
</I>
There are basically 2 solutions to this problem (actually 3):
- Adapt the software playing the media to stream the raw data over to
  the thin-client without reencoding and play that stream on the
  thin-client. Pros: same quality as local, Cons: possibly needs a lot
  of bandwith and processing power on the thin-client. Only works with
  adapted media-players.
- Adapt some video-API like XVideo to re-encode every video-stream its
  asked to play into some transfer format which is encodable in realtime
  and sufficiently small in bandwith usage. Pros: thin-clients may be
  smaller, works with every software that uses standard Video-APIs (so
  possibly not flash...), lower bandwith usage. Cons: Possibly wouldn't
  work with flash, needs a lot of processing power on the server,
  possibly too much for high quality or larger window sizes of the video
- Use some heuristics to recognize rapidly changing window contents
  (which probably is either video or a game). Encode that window content
  into a video stream. Pros: works with every software, including flash,
  games and other weird stuff (i guess there will be corner cases
  though). Cons: unbelievably ugly, lots of server load, possibly crappy
  quality.

&gt;<i> &gt; For true transparency the media would have to be played on the remote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; desktop media player but then the performance is bad.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To get satisfactory performance you have to use the media players on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; users machine but then you would not have seamless experience.
</I>&gt;<i> It is not entirely seamless but, at least for our purposes, it is much
</I>&gt;<i> better than saying, &quot;save the video to disk, transfer the file to your
</I>&gt;<i> local computer, now open it using your local media player.&quot; Let's do all
</I>&gt;<i> of that automatically for them.  That may not work well for your
</I>&gt;<i> environment but it would for ours.
</I>
The approaches described above practically preclude any scenario where
playing videos would be absolutely seamless. Practically all solutions
that do not take the third approach do only work with a few media
players (in practice: their &quot;special&quot; Windows Media Player and their
&quot;special&quot; Flash). I could be wrong and there are better solutions out
there, but everything I have seen so far suggests that there is no nice
and easy way...
