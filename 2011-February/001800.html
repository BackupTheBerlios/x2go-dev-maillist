We just tell clients that if they want really good video performance
then their users will need to use a local media player on their client
machine to play video.

There's really no good solution to be able to do this from a media
player on the remote desktop that delivers any type of acceptable
performance.

Maybe when the entire world has 1Gbps internet but otherwise just
configure things for a local media player.

And rather than trying to pass the actual content around it's just seems
easier to post the content on a webserver that the users can access from
their client machines.

Gerry
