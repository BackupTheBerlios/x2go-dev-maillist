Right now there is no simple way to do this with x2go or any of the
other remote access technologies.

For true transparency the media would have to be played on the remote
desktop media player but then the performance is bad.

To get satisfactory performance you have to use the media players on the
users machine but then you would not have seamless experience.

A 'Catch-22' scenario that will probably only be solved with future
network bandwidth increase.
