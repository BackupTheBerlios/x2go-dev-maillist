John, yes I've also been keeping my eye on some things like this.

There are a number of efforts cropping up that are trying to take
advantage of GPU hardware on the client. 

Wayland by Ubuntu is one that comes to mind. 

The idea is to just send the screen &quot;damage&quot; events down to the client
and let the client GPU hardware handle it.

Gerry
