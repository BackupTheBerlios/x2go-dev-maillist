Indeed, that would.

AFAIUI, you also agree that this is a pretty obscure corner case that is
not worth to have as default. Therefore, I suggest to drop the sudo
stuff completely and install x2gowrapper as 'suid x2gouser' so that no
additional configuration is necessary. With this change, the use-case
above doesn't work anymore.

In order to restore that functionality, the database schema would need
to be extended to implement a blacklist. And in fact, your explanation
kindof confirms that a blacklist would be more suited than the current
whitelist (i.e., the x2gousers group) approach.
