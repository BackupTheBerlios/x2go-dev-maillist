We've been working very heavily with the 3.01-18 code base and vcxsrv.
We have seen the problems you describe not using it, e.g., disappearing
mouse cursor).  For us, all seems to work well including sound except
for the screen corruption.  It is only in multi-window mode.  If you
launch in full screen or available area (-rootless - I'm not sure if
Alex exposed that - I haven't played with the new client personally),
you should not have the problem.  Multi-window does work perfectly well
with 3.01-17 and vcxsrv so it was something introduced in the last
release - John
