</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is where I disagree.  When we have control of the content and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; environment that works.  But that's not our environment.  We want as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seamless a user experience as possible whether they are browsing the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Internet and hit a video, clicking on an email attachment that happens
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be video, or viewing some kind of embedded video content.  We expect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; our clients to be able to work as closely as possible to their physical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; environment in their virtual environment.  The onus is on us to make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that possible as transparently as possible without changing their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; procedures.  That may not be true of all deployments but it is true of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ours - John
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right now there is no simple way to do this with x2go or any of the
</I>&gt;<i> other remote access technologies.
</I>Actually, although I have not used it, I believe Citrix is doing
something like this.  Whatever EyeOS is doing works very well.  HP is
taking a different approach by adapting their transport to the nature of
the video being transmitted.  If what I propose is feasible, we have a
possible solution.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For true transparency the media would have to be played on the remote
</I>&gt;<i> desktop media player but then the performance is bad.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To get satisfactory performance you have to use the media players on the
</I>&gt;<i> users machine but then you would not have seamless experience.
</I>It is not entirely seamless but, at least for our purposes, it is much
better than saying, &quot;save the video to disk, transfer the file to your
local computer, now open it using your local media player.&quot; Let's do all
of that automatically for them.  That may not work well for your
environment but it would for ours.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A 'Catch-22' scenario that will probably only be solved with future
</I>&gt;<i> network bandwidth increase.
</I>Not if what I propose if feasible or if we find a more video friendly
transport.
