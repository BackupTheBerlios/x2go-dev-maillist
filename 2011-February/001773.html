So I assume e.g. on host 'mike' the user named 'mike' is a local (only on
that host) member of group 'x2gousers'? If thats the case, just install
all x2gowrappers executable to the 'x2gousers' group only and you are
done. So its just a minimal change to your standard VM image that would
be needed. But for non-repudiation you will also need to prevent any other
user than 'mike' from logging in to the host 'mike' by ssh, so if your
setup works as intended, the permisions on the wrapper will be your
second line of defense, not your first.

&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, it does on small scales. And our approach wouldn't make the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make the x2gowrapper executable only for that group and not for others.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then you have exactly the same functionality as with 'sudo', but without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the hassle of setting up the sudo configuration (wich does never seem to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work automatically on installation). That would also be the suggested
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; migration path i guess. Additionally you can of course use database
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; black/whitelists, or you can set x2gowrapper o+rx and only use database
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; black/whitelists. In that sense our approach would also be far more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; flexible than the current sudo approach.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose this is true and appreciate the flexibility.  Just as we

</I>&gt;<i> ownership of x2gowrapper to the user's personal group and remove world
</I>&gt;<i> access.  Is that a correct understanding of how we could use what you
</I>&gt;<i> are proposing? I do hope those ownership and permissions changes wold be
</I>&gt;<i> preserved across an update.  Otherwise, I could see a security
</I>&gt;<i> nightmare.
</I>
You could also change the group to the user's private group, but I guess
that would be much more complicated than the approach described above.
And I agree that perhaps the postinstall script should take care not to
mess up the permissions of the wrapper if they have been changed (Or
perhaps a debconf question would be useful?).

&gt;<i> Again, our use shouldn't drive this decision but I wonder how many

</I>&gt;<i> and non-repudiation.  Thanks again for opening the discussion; I hope it
</I>&gt;<i> is proving helpful rather than burdensome! - John

Yes, its very helpful, exploring all the things people would like to do
really carves out the corner cases we need to think about. In that
sense, I'm very grateful for the active discussion since it prevents
nasty surprises that would happen if those corner cases were discovered
too late.



Ciao,

Alexander Wuerstlein.
