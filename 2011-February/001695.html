</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That would be very appreciated.  I think the next step is already in

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well.  In the meantime, we can slot in the bits into the code to make it

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rootless and fullscreen capabilities.  It will be even better if we can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> detect if there is an existing multiwindow.   We need to do all that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regardless of whom we ultimately use.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Alex, we would actually prefer you do that as we truly are not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developers.  Do you have time for that portion, i.e., not fixing vcxsrv
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but simply changing the X2Go Client code? If, not, we'll take our best
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stab at it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Gerry, if we find the vcxsrv folks are not able to get to this right
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> away, do you have anyone with X skills who could troubleshoot and fix
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it? That's way out of our league.  Thanks, all - John
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> John, if I did we'd have fixed it already. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> X is not within our skill sets.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> General question, is it possible to build a debug version of X?  Can X
</I>&gt;<i> be run under the control of a debugger?  If so, maybe breakpoints could
</I>&gt;<i> be set until we narrowed down the section of code causing the problem or
</I>&gt;<i> maybe we could tell where it was from a core file.  Just some thoughts.

I just looked at all the various mouse/keyboard issues that we've seen
w/X and window managers.

Multiple doodads... (had to restart X)
Tried to focus the nofocus window (had to restart X)
XID collision.  Trouble ahead. (had to restart X)
unknown keypress (translated set 2, code 0xd9 on SERIAL) ...
mouse pointer disappears but still works (had to restart X)
mouse pointer zooms offscreen (had to restart X)
dropdown menues stop working on mouse click (gnome-terminal)  (had to
restart X)
keystrokes fail in gnome-terminal - cursor turns to outlined block  (had
to restart X)

These occurred on both debian-based and redhat-based distros.

So there is plenty of room for discovery for these X issues.  And some
of them might ultimately be tied to the same solution.  I found that
some of these issues have been reported for years to Xorg and are still
not solved.  Of course some might be window manager issues.


Regards,
Gerry
