Are there any? Are there any hints that possible contributors did not
allow relicensing by NoMachine? Does anybody care?

You have no obligation to accept any contributions. Anyway, this
discussion leads nowhere, I don't like NoMachine stopping GPL releases,
but I don't see any _evidence_ that might inhibit them from doing so.

&gt;<i> It may be that NoMachine has acquired all the rights from all

</I>
The first time I heard about NX it was closed source with a GPL core,
all released by NoMachine. At first glance they primarily used code with
X/MIT/BSD/ISC style licenses.

My point is that we on this list don't know the exact licensing situation
for the NX code. That is enough to just use the GPL code in combined or
derived work. That is not enough to presume any further obligations on
part of NoMachine.

&gt;<i> More to the immediate needs of x2go though is the fact that NX OSS is
</I>&gt;<i> currently unmaintained. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And as pointed out, all the stakeholders in NX OSS need to join force to
</I>&gt;<i> provide for the continuance of the NX OSS codebase. 
</I>
That would be good indeed.
