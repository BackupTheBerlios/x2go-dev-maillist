And what about contributions that were made to NoMachine codebases prior
to 2004?  NoMachine project was releasing software prior to 2004.

You cannot just pick a point in time after the start of a codebase and
require contributors give you joint rights only from that point forward.

It may be that NoMachine has acquired all the rights from all
contributors ever in their codebase.  It is not easy to do.  Especially
when many projects start out without formal processes and procedures to
ensure audit trail and full accounting for all contributions.

So if new NX libs are closed source the question is can NM document that
they have secured all or joint rights to every contribution in the NX
codebase from every contributor, including prior to 2004?  Or did NM
completely rewrite the NX libs (I think this would be doubtful).


More to the immediate needs of x2go though is the fact that NX OSS is
currently unmaintained. 

And as pointed out, all the stakeholders in NX OSS need to join force to
provide for the continuance of the NX OSS codebase. 


Regards,
Gerry
