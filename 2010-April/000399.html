</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The build/install fails because of dependency's on the

</I>&lt;snip&gt;
We are a KDE site.  I have not used the tools for primarily two reasons:
1) ignorance - we hope to look at them at some point
2) Platform - we use CentOS Directory Server and not OpenLDAP.  We will
need to digest the schema and see how we port it before we can use it.

Regarding scalability, we are building an environment to accommodate
thousands of X2Go desktops (hopefully - business plans are one thing -
reality can be another).  We also run one X2Go desktop per virtual
machine using VServer in a fairly secure environment.

The scalability and platform issues are where we have made some changes.
We use a central PostgreSQL server.  We altered the X2Go database
scripts to not use the PostgreSQL super user and to use one schema per
desktop so no one can see another user's session information.  We
created a separate sessions table owned by the super user and updated
from the desktop tables via a trigger.  This gives us a central view of
all sessions with restricted access.

We do not use x2gocleansessions on each desktop lest we have thousands
of processes all hitting against the database every five seconds and
each consuming CPU cycles on the desktop.  It also requires more
privileges in the virtual machine than we are willing to give based upon
our security model.  Instead, we disabled the x2goserver init script and
moved the session cleaning to the VServer host which pulls upon the
central session table.

We then centralized the printing on a single CUPS server and altered
cups-x2go so that it can support multiple X2Go Servers.  We pull the
server information from the central session table (I believe - I haven't
looked at that in a while).

So one can build a highly scalable environment.  That doesn't mean the
tools are not important.  I suspect storing information in LDAP will be
essential when the broker product becomes available.  I suppose it is
valuable now if one wants to eliminate manual configuration of the
client.  In our case, access is across the Internet for all users and
the LDAP server is not publicly exposed.  We've thus handled it another
way.  Hope this helps - John
