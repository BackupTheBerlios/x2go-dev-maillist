<PRE>hello,

for now 2 weeks we have send a mail to the mailing list, but i have not 
see it and so i don't kow why, we send mails before without problems.
we have a question: we would like to use x2go for an internet cafe in 
africa, do you know internet cafe software, we have tried to install 
maelys, a program which is written from an african friend, bt it was not 
working, do you know other software?


i send here a copy of the mail again

/x2go in cameroon
hello,
after a long silence, we give you some infos. we have installed in 
cameroon limbe an x2go network in a school (Presbytarian Girl's 
Secondary  School).  this school has 800 students and have a computer 
lab, but most of the computers are bad. we were asked to help: so we 
build a x2go network, with a server (1.5 gb ram)  and 4 thin clients (5 
watts low power computers). as you can see on our internet page, we 
could connect other computers of this computer lab, so we could make a 
network with 11 working places. (it is anyway not much for a school with 
800 students, but better than nothing)
the server has ubuntu 9.10 as basis and we load x2go-home.
we need memory, most of our machine has 512 mb ram or 1 gb ram
switch or hub and especially help, material as moral...

thanks
