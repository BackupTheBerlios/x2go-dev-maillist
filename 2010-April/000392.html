<PRE>Thanks Paul &amp; Jonh for your replies. You didn't see the reply of John
? Maybe because he inconsciously click on &quot;reply&quot; and not &quot;reply to
all&quot; which didn't happen if we use a forum (Yes, I don't like the only
optioin &quot;Mailling list&quot; ;-) )

(Such a pain to do the &quot;layout&quot;, around 25min ;-) )

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Everyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm new here. I don't have developper skills like most of you but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there's no Web-Place to talk about this nice product X2go.
</I>&gt;<i>John : &quot;&lt;grin&gt; Many of us are in the same boat!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Paul : &quot;If you like a forum, you can go to here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.linux.terminal-server.x2go.devel">http://news.gmane.org/gmane.linux.terminal-server.x2go.devel</A>
</I>&gt;<i> You can also post messages there.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm doing some testing to implement this solution for some of my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clients. I tested Ulteo and NX Nomachine. After some more researches I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> found the FreeNX project which apparently was not supported anymore ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> till I found this X2go project.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I read about linux4africa where I can find some ideas of implementation,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the blog about x2go, but not enough to see the real functions of x2go.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>John :&quot;We have found it an outstanding project.  I just wish I had the
</I>&gt;<i>profitability to fund Heinz and Oleksandr full time! (working on it
</I>&gt;<i>though ;)  ).&quot;
</I>
They'll find funds quickly with the Cloud Computing technology !! I'm
sure the donations would be huge if the x2go product seems to be
stable and followed.


&gt;<i>John :&quot;The documentation is quite sparse.  We are feverishly working on a pile
</I>&gt;<i>of documentation we hope to donate as soon as we finish it.  In the
</I>&gt;<i>meantime, you can ask away on the list and we'll help as we can.
</I>
I'll make a new post on the mailing list to expose my case and my needs.


&gt;&gt;<i> In my case for example, I love Ubuntu and I really want to propose it to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my client. But there is a big problem about x2go on Ubuntu : No
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> administration console.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure what you exactly need. I don't use the administration
</I>&gt;<i> module. You can live without it ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>What i need it's an easy interface to control / maintain / supervise
the x2go users, servers, sessions. You live without the administration
module ? Fine ... for you. Can you give me at least the configuration
files we have to play with ?

&gt;&gt;<i> Apparently the module kcontrol is not any more installable on this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distibution (Ubuntu 9.10 in my case and probably the 10.04 in few
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> months) ... and nobody talk about it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is anyone found the solution in this case ?
</I>&gt;<i>John :&quot;We started on Ubuntu as our base platform and eventually became quite
</I>&gt;<i>disenchanted for many of the same reasons cited by the Mepis project
</I>&gt;<i>when they switched from Debian to Ubuntu and then back to Debian.  We,
</I>&gt;<i>too, have switched to Debian.  We are also very favorably disposed to
</I>&gt;<i>RedHat but find the RedHat schedule too slow and the Fedora schedule too
</I>&gt;<i>aggressive for our needs.  Debian Lenny + backports is about the best
</I>&gt;<i>balance we can find.
</I>&gt;<i>&lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>Good luck with X2Go; it is truly a fabulous solution - John&quot;
</I>

&gt;<i> First development platform is Debian. There are packages for Ubuntu, but
</I>&gt;<i> not everything is supported there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We would like it if comebody would make Ubuntu-packages, but the point
</I>&gt;<i> is that Ubuntu makes many releases. It would cost much time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The point for me not using Ubuntu on a server is that it does not give
</I>&gt;<i> security support on many packages. Try this command and you will see you
</I>&gt;<i> are using many packages without security-support:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> aptitude search '?and(~s universe,~i)'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm sure Debian is a great product . Ubuntu was based on it. I worked
in IT for 10 years and I have always been between Microsoft and Linux.
But I know the easiest linux platform for &quot;windows&quot; users is Ubuntu. I
tried some before and I really feel Ubuntu will be THE alternative of
Windows for users.

&gt;&gt;<i> I read about the reason to not get a forum and I don't get it. The forum
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is easy to find an answer with the search module.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can search this list on many pleases, e.g. here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.linux.terminal-server.x2go.devel">http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.linux.terminal-server.x2go.devel</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And you don't have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> go there everyday to see if there's some new topics or updates, you just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have to configure the notifications.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hope the X2Go project will be followed by many many people !!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can follow the list by mail, usenet news, as 4 kinds of rss-feeds,
</I>&gt;<i> as a forum and blog-like....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Wish you a nice day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You too ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you don't like mailinglists, try Gmane. Works very nice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Paul van der Vlis.
