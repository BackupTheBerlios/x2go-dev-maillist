</I>
I know this problem. It's a setting in the mailinglist software. I like
the default &quot;reply to all&quot;.

You don't have this problem if you use Gmane. Try it.

&gt;<i> which didn't happen if we use a forum 
</I>
I really hate forums, I want to have my messages in my mailclient.

&gt;<i> (Yes, I don't like the only optioin &quot;Mailling list&quot; ;-) )
</I>
Why do you say that?  I wrote already how you can use this mailinglist
with Gmane...

&gt;<i> (Such a pain to do the &quot;layout&quot;, around 25min ;-) )
</I>
???  I don't understand you.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Everyone,

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm new here. I don't have developper skills like most of you but

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Paul : &quot;If you like a forum, you can go to here:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm doing some testing to implement this solution for some of my
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> clients. I tested Ulteo and NX Nomachine. After some more researches I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> found the FreeNX project which apparently was not supported anymore ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> till I found this X2go project.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I read about linux4africa where I can find some ideas of implementation,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the blog about x2go, but not enough to see the real functions of x2go.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> John :&quot;We have found it an outstanding project.  I just wish I had the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> profitability to fund Heinz and Oleksandr full time! (working on it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though ;)  ).&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They'll find funds quickly with the Cloud Computing technology !! I'm
</I>&gt;<i> sure the donations would be huge if the x2go product seems to be
</I>&gt;<i> stable and followed.
</I>
The product is allready stable.

&gt;&gt;<i> John :&quot;The documentation is quite sparse.  We are feverishly working on a pile
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of documentation we hope to donate as soon as we finish it.  In the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> meantime, you can ask away on the list and we'll help as we can.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll make a new post on the mailing list to expose my case and my needs.
</I>
OK.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In my case for example, I love Ubuntu and I really want to propose it to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> my client. But there is a big problem about x2go on Ubuntu : No
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> administration console.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am not sure what you exactly need. I don't use the administration
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> module. You can live without it ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What i need it's an easy interface to control / maintain / supervise
</I>&gt;<i> the x2go users, servers, sessions. You live without the administration
</I>&gt;<i> module ? Fine ... for you. Can you give me at least the configuration
</I>&gt;<i> files we have to play with ?
</I>
There are 2 configfiles in /etc/x2go, but you don't have to change them.

I use a &quot;newuser&quot; script. You have to create a new user, and you have to
add that user to the group &quot;x2gousers&quot;.

In my script I copy some files into the homedirectory of the user, and I
do some Gnome settings with &quot;gconftool-2&quot;.

What do you want more?

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Apparently the module kcontrol is not any more installable on this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> distibution (Ubuntu 9.10 in my case and probably the 10.04 in few
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> months) ... and nobody talk about it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Is anyone found the solution in this case ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> John :&quot;We started on Ubuntu as our base platform and eventually became quite
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disenchanted for many of the same reasons cited by the Mepis project
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when they switched from Debian to Ubuntu and then back to Debian.  We,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too, have switched to Debian.  We are also very favorably disposed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RedHat but find the RedHat schedule too slow and the Fedora schedule too
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aggressive for our needs.  Debian Lenny + backports is about the best
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> balance we can find.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Good luck with X2Go; it is truly a fabulous solution - John&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First development platform is Debian. There are packages for Ubuntu, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not everything is supported there.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We would like it if comebody would make Ubuntu-packages, but the point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is that Ubuntu makes many releases. It would cost much time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The point for me not using Ubuntu on a server is that it does not give
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> security support on many packages. Try this command and you will see you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are using many packages without security-support:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aptitude search '?and(~s universe,~i)'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure Debian is a great product . Ubuntu was based on it. 
</I>
Ubuntu is based on it. For every release they copy &quot;debian unstable&quot;,
and make changes to it.

&gt;<i> I worked
</I>&gt;<i> in IT for 10 years and I have always been between Microsoft and Linux.
</I>&gt;<i> But I know the easiest linux platform for &quot;windows&quot; users is Ubuntu. I
</I>&gt;<i> tried some before and I really feel Ubuntu will be THE alternative of
</I>&gt;<i> Windows for users.
</I>
Ubuntu is a bit more simple for the administrator maybe, for the users
it's not more or less simple in my opinion. The user works with
applications, not with operating systems.

With regards,
Paul van der Vlis.
