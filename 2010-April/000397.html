&gt;<i> Hi Everyone,

Hello Cyril,

this is the right place to talk about x2go. We've focused our 
communication on the list so that nothing gets lost or fragmented.


&gt;<i> I read about linux4africa where I can find some ideas of implementation,
</I>&gt;<i> the blog about x2go, but not enough to see the real functions of x2go.
</I>
x2go is a remote access protocoll with audio, file, print and display 
support. It is modular and you can use it to access single programms, 
whole desktops with the help of desktop clients, commandline clients and 
pxe boot environments.

&gt;<i> In my case for example, I love Ubuntu and I really want to propose it to
</I>&gt;<i> my client. But there is a big problem about x2go on Ubuntu : No
</I>&gt;<i> administration console.
</I>
A little &quot;administration help&quot; can be accessed via the 
x2gognomebindings. After installing them, you can administrate 
everything regarding your session inside your session. For example 
session suspending, file sharing and printing.

You can also use the commandline tools to administrate other users and 
their sessions.

As commandline tools are bound to the local system (Ok, you can access 
them via ssh), we've decided that we will change the architecture of our 
kcontrol modules. That will answer a lot of questions asked before like: 
Why don't you have a php admninstration thing like phpmyadmin? Why don't 
you have python/gtk administration guis so they look nice on ubuntu? Why 
don't you have java administration tools, so you can deploy them via 
webstart... (this too was asked for silverlight, mono, cocoa/mac, 
IPhone, Android,...).

In the release after baikal (that is the name of 3.1 - the upcomming 
release - as always a place where you can find &quot;seehunde&quot;) will contain 
an administration api accessible via JSON. So everybody can use this API 
to write his own Idea of the &quot;best admin tool&quot; (or he can reduce it to 
only needed commands).

At the moment we don't know which architecture we'll use for our own 
admin tools, but I think they will be Qt4 (but using the new api).


&gt;<i> I read about the reason to not get a forum and I don't get it. The forum
</I>&gt;<i> is easy to find an answer with the search module. And you don't have to
</I>&gt;<i> go there everyday to see if there's some new topics or updates, you just
</I>&gt;<i> have to configure the notifications.
</I>
We won't go back to multiple communication platforms - the reduction of 
only one group has made things so much easier. But I really should give 
more hints on the website how to use GMANE.

There will be a site called &quot;x2go-community&quot; made by a member of 
linux4afrika. This site will not be operated by us but maybe it is more 
a beginners meeting place. Linux4Afrika is a great community and they 
helped us a lot in the past. And we'll always help them to answer questions.


And as you are all awaiting our next release:

This is a screenshot of the changed artwork of the client:

The last things that need to be done before the release are to fix some 
minor issues and to paint the missing icons
Yes there will be a Firefox Plugin any you'll be able to use it to 
access x2goservers with all features and with &quot;full speed&quot;.

best regards,

Heinz
