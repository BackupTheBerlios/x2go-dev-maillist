<PRE>Hi John,

thank you for posting this news. It is very interesting what already can
be done with this closed platform.
Though I really would like to see a real open mobile platform...
I tested the MeeGo Tablet Edition on my EEEPC and it is still based on
Xorg and the userland tools. I don't know what will happen to this
platform in future, but it really would be a better platform to run
x2goclient.

Yes Alex's macbook is lost.

No, we don't own an IPad.

&gt;&gt;<i> AppStore and GPL software
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There also has been an issue around AppStore and GPL in January 2011:

</I>
x2goclient is made with the help of C++ anduses Qt. If you want to get
your app inside the app store it should be cocoa and objective C. There
are some rules about the allowed number of services that can be started
too (as far as I know).

&gt;&gt;<i> If there will be an X2goClient for iPad in the future it will surely  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need a distribution pathway. How would that work? (I am not at all  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> familiar with Macs, but may I bring up the question nonetheless?).
</I>
Maybe it is more realistic to combine one of the ajaxvnc solutions with
a virtual x2go display.

Regards,

Heinz
