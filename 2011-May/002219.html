<PRE>Hi St&#232;phane,

GREAT!!!!

</I>&gt;<i> client part into the &quot;main&quot; component (supported set of packages).
</I>
Basically, our approach of getting X2go into Ubuntu is an open ITP for Debian:
<A HREF="http://bugs.debian.org/465821">http://bugs.debian.org/465821</A>

For this project a pkg-x2go team has formed on Alioth:
<A HREF="https://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-x2go/">https://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-x2go/</A>

Everything around packaging for Debian (and subsequently Ubuntu) we  
should discuss on the related mailing list  
(<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">pkg-x2go-devel at lists.alioth.org</A>):
<A HREF="https://alioth.debian.org/mail/?group_id=100595">https://alioth.debian.org/mail/?group_id=100595</A>

&gt;<i> Today, I'm working on updating our nxproxy, libxcomp and libxcompshad
</I>&gt;<i> packages to their latest upstream releases (3.5.0), merging the
</I>&gt;<i> excellent packaging work the x2go team has been doing.
</I>
Please take a look at our Git on code.x2go.org. I have just today  
improved installation from Makefile and cleaned up the packages. We  
should definitely make sure that we do not induldge in redundant  
effort here.

I have not known about NX 3.5 yet (DAMN!!!) Is there an active  
community around NXv3 alive somewhere else apart from the X2go  
community??? For Debian we will provide upstream NX. That should be  
the same for Ubuntu (if you start uploading packages to Ubuntu before  
we do so for Debian).

DO you think you can work on our NX code base and do the changes  
there? Work on each Git project (nxcomp, nxcompext, nxcompshad) could  
start in a Git branch first.

The question is, if it is advisable to update to NX 3.5 first and then  
packaging for Ubuntu. My recommendation is to get packages into  
Debian/Ubuntu first and then start working on NX 3.5. But I do not  
have a clue how dramatic the changes are.

Do you have a clue how intense the effect on x2goagent (formerly  
x2goagent) will be???

&gt;<i> Next on my list will be to get python-x2go into the Ubuntu archive as
</I>&gt;<i> that's what we'll be using for our client integration (Ubuntu Software
</I>&gt;<i> Center is in python) and finally I'll be working on getting the
</I>&gt;<i> x2goserver itself in the repository (lower priority than the rest) so we
</I>&gt;<i> don't need a PPA to build our servers.
</I>
Again, how about working on Debian inclusion. I am not involved with  
Ubuntu policies too much. Will there be syncs between Oneiric and  
Debian sid in the future? Or is that pathway already closed?

If closed then I suggest you do your work for Oneiric but for the  
Ubuntu p-series we count on Debian sid? What do you think?

&gt;<i> I hope to have most packages built for Oneiric in my test PPA
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://launchpad.net/~stgraber/+archive/experimental">https://launchpad.net/~stgraber/+archive/experimental</A>) so I can do some
</I>&gt;<i> tests to make sure these don't break anything (including FreeNX/qtnx)
</I>&gt;<i> and if everything looks good, I'll be pushing these into the archive
</I>&gt;<i> later this week.
</I>
St&#233;phane! Couldn't we arrange that you commit the work you perform to  
our Git which then will be synced to our PPAs (lauchpad.net/~x2go) and  
from there you upload to Ubuntu main????

This would make much more sense to me. Please apply for team  
membership, so that Heinz can give you edit-access to  
launchpad.net/~x2go.

I would really appreciated to go this way!!!!

&gt;<i> Once I'm done and everything works for me, I'll be forwarding the list
</I>&gt;<i> of packaging changes I had to do (if any) so we can ensure your
</I>&gt;<i> dailybuilds and the &quot;official&quot; Ubuntu packages are in sync.
</I>
Again, why not join the X2go team???

&gt;<i> Thanks for the great work and looking forward to working more with you.
</I>
:<i>-)
</I>
Greets + looking forward to further exchange (as started in the Debian  
Edu / Edubuntu cooperation!!!!)

Mike

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">PS at list</A>: St&#233;phane Graber and Johnathan Carter are also heavily  
involved in EduBuntu development and we have just last week met for an  
online meeting dealing about intenseive cooperation between EduBuntu  
and DebianEdu. Great that we overlap in the area of X2go as well (X2go  
has an active cooperation running with Skolelinux/DebianEdu Germany!!!)
