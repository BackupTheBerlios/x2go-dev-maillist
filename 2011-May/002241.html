But that's exactly my point, there is really no need for breaking the
current setup before we have a something that can replace it. And now
you propose to move the current known-to-work branches to something that
doesn't even exist yet.

IOW: Go ahead and do whatever you want to do on alioth. When it's ready,
we can reconsider if it's worth moving there, but currently, I really
don't see any benefit in breaking the current infrastructure. And for
St&#233;phane's work, well, what's the problem with integrating it in the
*current* infrastructure on code.x2go.org?

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   o provide X2go-specific patches for NX 3.5 upstream on X2go  upstream
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     recommended to be incorporated by package maintainers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> did you already look at those 'patches'?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This might be a misunderstanding.
</I>
No, it's not. Please have a look at them.

[...]

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   o draw St&#233;phanes work to collab-maint on Alioth
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Why not on code.x2go.org?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because code.x2go.or is intended for X2go upstream development. Not
</I>&gt;<i> for building Debian packages.
</I>
I don't know what to say here, I'm speechless.

&gt;<i> On Alioth's collab-maint workspace all Debian developers have write
</I>&gt;<i> access by default. That's my main reason for hosting the packaging  code
</I>&gt;<i> there.
</I>
Still, so far you have found exactly one DD (i.e., me) willing to work
on x2go upstream. Just granting access to everybody is unlikely to
improve the situation.
