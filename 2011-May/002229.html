<PRE>I sent the e-mail below to fix the misunderstanding on both mailing-lists but forgot to set the right sender and so got stuck in the moderation queue :)
Since then, Mike clarified the confusion but here it's anyway.

</I>
Bad timing, I just sent an e-mail to pkg-x2go-devel about this :)

It was actually a typo I made this morning. I don't plan on having
nxagent and x2goagent compatible.
They already have a different name so they can perfectly co-exist in the
archive. X2goagent is from my point of view a clear fork of nxagent, so
it's fine to have both.

What I'm currently working on is getting python-x2go in the archive,
which means updating its dependencies:
 - nxproxy
 - nxcomp

I have test packages for these two including all the changes from x2go,
the new upstream release and remaining patches from Debian.

&gt;<i> But still, we (x2go-dev upstream) have to find a disposition on the  
</I>&gt;<i> dual-upstream issue around NX libs.
</I>
As mentioned in my last e-mail (just a few minutes ago), my problem is
with:
 - nxcomp
 - nxcompext
 - nxcompshad
 - nxproxy

Where we have two &quot;upstreams&quot; for the same code.
x2go would have to choose to either fork the code and rename them to
x2go* or maintain a patchset on top of NoMachine's code that maintainer
can use in their packages.


&gt;<i> In x2go-upstream we have to discuss if our nx* packages in Git are  
</I>&gt;<i> actually a hijack (as NoMachine still seems to be active around NX  
</I>&gt;<i> 3.5). Due to the latest NXv3.5 release by NoMachine there now exists a  
</I>&gt;<i> dual-upstream situation... This should have been avoided and now has  
</I>&gt;<i> to be dealt with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, I see two possibilities (for X2go into Debian without  
</I>&gt;<i> bringing up namespace issues), but I might be lacking sight here:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. We make X2go work with NoMachine's NX 3.5 (complemented through a  
</I>&gt;<i> patchset provided by X2go, this patchset may not break NX  
</I>&gt;<i> functionality -&gt; qtnx, freenx, etc., but improve functionality with  
</I>&gt;<i> X2go).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. We really fork NX libs, nxproxy (as already happened with  
</I>&gt;<i> x2goagent). That would mean a renaming of libraries and also Git  
</I>&gt;<i> projects etc, e.g.: x2goproxy, x2gocomp, x2gocompext, x2gocompshad.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please stay tuned around this topic and contribute to the discussion,  
</I>&gt;<i> if possible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
