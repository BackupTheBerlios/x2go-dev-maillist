<PRE>Hello, all.  We've received a number of queries about running X2Go on an
iPAD.  My understanding to this point is that the absolute fundamentals
are missing.  However, I was recently sent the following:

i-SSH for the iPad comes up well in reviews: 
Description

A full featured SSH and Telnet emulator of VT100, VT102, VT220, ANSI,
and xterm terminals integrated with a tunneled VNC client and an X
server
Customer Reviews
Great SSH client
     
by Mikaey0

This is definitely a great SSH client. Everything I use works as I
expect it to when connecting to my box at home. Definitely nice to see a
working X server for the iPad as well!
Amazingly functional
     
by Nick75985

Continues to amaze me with new functionality I discover.
Never crashed on me.
Incredibly full-featured and useful app.
     
by quantumonion

Edit: Wow, TextExpander support just added! If an app could give you
goose bumps, iSSH would be that app.

Only two suggestions come to mind.

1. TextExpander support (done!)
2. Native Dropbox support for the connection list

It's possible to save the connection list to Dropbox with the export to
clipboard feature, but it'd be great to offer an option to auto-sync any
changes automatically.

The above are just nits though. This has become one of those
indispensable apps that you'd have to pry my cold dead fingers off of
before I'd give it up.


Given the above, what would it take to get X2Go to run on an iPAD using
i-SSH? Is anyone interested if giving it a run? It's definitely outside
of our skill set.  Thanks - John
