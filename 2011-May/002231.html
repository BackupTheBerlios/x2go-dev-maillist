<PRE>Hello,

I just finished testing nxproxy and nxcomp with x2goclient, python-x2go
and qtnx on Ubuntu Oneiric.
Test was successful with no regression that I could see.

So I now have:
 - nxproxy 3.5.0-1-0ubuntu1
 - nxcomp 3.5.0-1-0ubuntu1

Uploading in Oneiric, packages will be available to all users in a few
minutes.

As I mentioned earlier, I've been basing these two uploads on a clean
NoMachine tarball and re-applied the changes from the existing Debian
package and from x2go's git.
They can all be found in the (relatively well documented)
debian/patches/ directory of the source packages.

Links:
 - <A HREF="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nxproxy/3.5.0-1-0ubuntu1">https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nxproxy/3.5.0-1-0ubuntu1</A>
 - <A HREF="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nxcomp/3.5.0-1-0ubuntu1">https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nxcomp/3.5.0-1-0ubuntu1</A>

I'd think these two meet Debian criteria for upload, so if anyone with
upload rights to Debian can help getting them in there it'd help
minimizing the delta between Ubuntu and Debian (as I'd ask for a &quot;sync&quot;
from Debian, thereby removing any remaining delta).

The full delta with Debian/Ubuntu's current 3.2 packages is available
at:
 -
<A HREF="http://launchpadlibrarian.net/72109361/nxproxy_3.2.0-1-1_3.5.0-1-0ubuntu1.diff.gz">http://launchpadlibrarian.net/72109361/nxproxy_3.2.0-1-1_3.5.0-1-0ubuntu1.diff.gz</A>
 -
<A HREF="http://launchpadlibrarian.net/72109360/nxcomp_3.2.0-7-1.1_3.5.0-1-0ubuntu1.diff.gz">http://launchpadlibrarian.net/72109360/nxcomp_3.2.0-7-1.1_3.5.0-1-0ubuntu1.diff.gz</A>

As promised, attached to this e-mail are a few patches which I &quot;think&quot;
should be merged into x2go's git repository for future daily builds of
the packages.

 - nxproxy-update-debian-control.patch:
   - removes the build-dep on the purely virtual libstdc++-dev which
proved to not be needed (at least on Ubuntu)
   - adds a build-dep on dh-autoreconf
   - suggests qtnx as well as x2goclient
   - update the build-dep on debhelper (as the override in debian/rules
needs a pretty recent dh)
 - nxproxy-update-manpage-mention-nx.patch:
   - update the manpage to also mention NX

 - nxcomp-debian-patch-sa_restorer.patch
   - patch taken from Debian package, fixes build on ia64 and alpha
 - nxcomp-debian-update-control.patch
   - removes the build-dep on the purely virtual libstdc++-dev which
proved to not be needed (at least on Ubuntu)
   - update the build-dep on debhelper (as the override in debian/rules
needs a pretty recent dh)
   - remove duplicate section tag
 - nxcomp-debian-update-copyright.patch
   - update year of NoMachine copyright


The result is that both sources packages are lintian-clean with lintian
2.5 including &quot;I:&quot; tags.
The resulting binary packages are lintian-clean with lintian 2.5 though
some have &quot;I:&quot; tags warnings that should be fixed in the future (library
symbol and some fixes for the manpage), lintian output attached.

I'll now start working on python-x2go, making sure it's in shape to be
added to the Ubuntu archive and will get it uploaded so hopefully it
should be in Ubuntu by the end of next week (it needs to go through
quite extensive review as it's a new package).

Have a good weekend!

N: 
N:    Lintian found a spelling error in the given binary. Lintian has a list

N:    
N:    If the string containing the spelling error is translated with the help
N:    of gettext or a similar tool, please fix the error in the translations
N:    as well as the English text to avoid making the translations fuzzy. With
N:    gettext, for example, this means you should also fix the spelling
N:    mistake in the corresponding msgids in the *.po files.

N:    &quot;Description:&quot; field) is only one or two lines long. The extended
N:    description should provide a user with enough information to decide
N:    whether they want to install this package, what it contains, and how it

I: nxproxy: hyphen-used-as-minus-sign usr/share/man/man1/nxproxy.1.gz:23
N: 
N:    This manual page seems to contain a hyphen where a minus sign was
N:    intended. By default, &quot;-&quot; chars are interpreted as hyphens (U+2010) by
N:    groff, not as minus signs (U+002D). Since options to programs use minus
N:    signs (U+002D), this means for example in UTF-8 locales that you cannot
N:    cut and paste options, nor search for them easily. The Debian groff
N:    package currently forces &quot;-&quot; to be interpreted as a minus sign due to
N:    the number of manual pages with this problem, but this is a
N:    Debian-specific modification and hopefully eventually can be removed.
N:    
N:    &quot;-&quot; must be escaped (&quot;\-&quot;) to be interpreted as minus. If you really
N:    intend a hyphen (normally you don't), write it as &quot;\(hy&quot; to emphasise
N:    that fact. See groff(7) and especially groff_char(7) for details, and
N:    also the thread starting with
N:    <A HREF="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2003/debian-devel-200303/msg01481.h">http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2003/debian-devel-200303/msg01481.h</A>
N:    tml
N:    
N:    If you use some tool that converts your documentation to groff format,
N:    this tag may indicate a bug in the tool. Some tools convert dashes of
N:    any kind to hyphens. The safe way of converting dashes is to convert
N:    them to &quot;\-&quot;.
N:    
N:    Because this error can occur very often, Lintian shows only the first 10
N:    occurrences for each man page and give the number of suppressed
N:    occurrences. If you want to see all warnings, run Lintian with the
N:    -d/--debug option.
N:    
N:    Refer to the groff_char(7) manual page for details.
