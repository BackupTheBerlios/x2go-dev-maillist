&gt;<i> Hello, all.  We've seen this bug rarely but enough to know that it is a

</I>&gt;<i> something in the NX libraries:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The user called because she could not see her mouse cursor in her
</I>&gt;<i> virtual desktop.  It was visible in her physical desktop. As we later
</I>&gt;<i> observed, it was indeed present in the virtual desktop, e.g., if she
</I>&gt;<i> happened to stop the mouse over a file in Konqueror, it would display
</I>&gt;<i> the thumbnail, but the mouse cursor was not visible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We tried suspending and reconnecting; that did not work.  I could see
</I>&gt;<i> where the mouse was supposed to be via my VNC session to her physical
</I>&gt;<i> desktop so I tried to change the mouse cursor theme but that did not
</I>&gt;<i> work (and required a restart of KDE).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, before rebooting to try to re-establish the connection between
</I>&gt;<i> her physical and virtual desktops to display the mouse cursor, we
</I>&gt;<i> thought to suspend her X2Go session and then completely close her X2Go
</I>&gt;<i> client.  When she restarted the client and reconnected to her X2Go
</I>&gt;<i> session, the mouse had re-appeared.  We did not need to reboot the
</I>&gt;<i> physical computer.

We saw this again today for the same user.  Has anyone else experienced
this? Thanks - John
