</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello, all.  We've seen this bug rarely but enough to know that it is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; real bug and not just a coincidence. Here is the report from our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; internal trouble ticket.  Unfortunately, it smells like it might be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something in the NX libraries:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The user called because she could not see her mouse cursor in her
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; virtual desktop.  It was visible in her physical desktop. As we later
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; observed, it was indeed present in the virtual desktop, e.g., if she
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; happened to stop the mouse over a file in Konqueror, it would display
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the thumbnail, but the mouse cursor was not visible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We tried suspending and reconnecting; that did not work.  I could see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where the mouse was supposed to be via my VNC session to her physical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; desktop so I tried to change the mouse cursor theme but that did not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work (and required a restart of KDE).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Finally, before rebooting to try to re-establish the connection between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; her physical and virtual desktops to display the mouse cursor, we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thought to suspend her X2Go session and then completely close her X2Go
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; client.  When she restarted the client and reconnected to her X2Go
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; session, the mouse had re-appeared.  We did not need to reboot the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; physical computer.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> We saw this again today for the same user.  Has anyone else experienced
</I>&gt;<i> this? Thanks - John
</I>&lt;snip&gt;
We now have another user who experienced this twice today.  I'm willing
to put in the time to troubleshoot this but I'm not sure where to begin.
Any ideas? Thanks - John
