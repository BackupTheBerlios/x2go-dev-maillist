<PRE>Hi, Mike.

What do you think about making this behaviour default?
Because doing logoff by default seems to be a more secure way (and
default settings should be secure) + it doesn't require you to
close-and-reopen window if you want to de-authenticate from the broker
(and switch to other sessions).
I think it would be a good idea, especially if this session broker
system is mainly aimed at setups with thin clients (less configuration
changes for main use-case).
