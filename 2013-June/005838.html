 python-x2go (0.4.0.4) RELEASED; urgency=low
 .
   * New upstream version (0.4.0.4):
     - Save exports in session profile directly after mounting/unmounting a share
       if the session profile parameter restoreexports is set.
     - Fix the restoreexports logic on mount/unmount/unmount all requests.
       Make sure client-side offline network shares do not get purged from the
       session profile configuration if unavailable. (Fixes: #192).
     - Become aware of fixed paramiko features since paramiko 1.11.0. Stop
       monkey patching those methods that got fixed in 1.11.0.
     - Ignore KeyError exceptions in session cache for suddenly removed cache items.
       Silence/fix some race conditions on connection failures.
     - Support mounting client-side folders on UNC paths.
     - Enable keepalive callbacks on open SSH client connections.
     - Only do x2golistmounts calls for the session cache on running sessions.
     - Fix renaming of profile names.
