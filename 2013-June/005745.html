<PRE> Hello!

 After not getting freenx working properly on a clean install of CentOS 
 6.4, someone advised me to install x2go server.  I was surprised by the 
 ease of installation, using the RHEL6 repository.  Using an x2go client 
 on Ubuntu 12.04 to connect, things worked fantastic out of the box.

 However, after a reboot of the CentOS 6.4 machine, the client can no 
 longer connect.  I've presented this issue to #x2go on Freenode, where 
 sunweaver was gracious enough to provide some useful information.  He 
 advised me to post about my issue on this mailing list.

 After an unsuccessful connection attempt, this is in /var/log/syslog 
 with debug log level:  <A HREF="http://pastebin.com/L3e4xP6g">http://pastebin.com/L3e4xP6g</A>  The x2go client 
 says:  <A HREF="http://pastebin.com/CiGatMeS">http://pastebin.com/CiGatMeS</A>  When I connect, I get those errors. 
 When I re-connect it shows an active session, but I can't resume it.  I 
 can start a new one, but then the same thing happens as the first time.  
 The error message shows up and next time there's 2 sessions in the 
 session popup during login.

 Per sunweaver's suggestions, I've tried   rm -f 
 /var/lib/x2go/x2go_sessions  and  x2godbadmin --createdb   but that 
 didn't solve the problem.  There is also no process x2gocleansessions 
 running.  There is nothing actually running with x2go in the name (ps 
 aux | grep x2go returns nothing).  When starting x2gocleansessions 
 manually, I get:  <A HREF="http://pastebin.com/fExxSJ5p">http://pastebin.com/fExxSJ5p</A>

 Another suggestion was to create a brand new user account, but there I 
 get the same error as with the other user account.  I've tried a fresh 
 account on both server and client.

 About the not locating x2gologlevel.pm bit (the x2gocleansessions 
 error)... seems like it's include path is insufficient.  The file is in 
 /usr/lib64/x2go/x2gologlevel.pm.  Not sure how to fix that and if it's 
 indication of bigger problems.  Also interesting... in the sudoers file 
 there's a reference to /usr/bin/x2gopgwrapper, but this executable does 
 not exist.

 If you have any suggestions on things which I could try that might shed 
 further light on this, please let me know.

 Also, the machine that's plagued with this issue is a fresh 
 installation, with nothing sensitive, critical or even mildly important 
 running there yet.  I could provide you with ssh access to this machine 
 so you can have a look around and/or attempt to connect.  If that helps, 
 please find me on irc.freenode.net in #x2go under nickname Hyperbyte, so 
 we can work something out.

 Kindest regards,
 Jan Middelkoop
