I believe the problem at hand is that there is only a Firefox plugin available. If a display could be delivered via HTML5 then it becomes truly portable. I could walk into a cyber-cafe (and yes am aware of security concerns) and connect to my work computer using FF, IE, CHROME, or any other HTML5 browser.  That would make a very powerful business tool indeed.
