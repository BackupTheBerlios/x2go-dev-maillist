<PRE>Hi all,

As Reinhard has mentioned in another post: Dicks setup requires a  
complete lock-down-kiosk-mode-kind-of-thing. He wants a user to be  
able to run a small set of commands only (i.e. the rootless  
applications he wants to provide to his customers). From his  
perspective AFAIK a user logged in via SSH is a security issue. May it  
be so.

&gt;&gt;<i> The $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND contains the original command that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> client wants to execute on the server. This command is checked against
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the allowed commands for the user within the wrapper.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From the invocation I infer, that the intended language for the
</I>&gt;<i> wrapper is shellskript. This is extremely dangerous if intended as a
</I>&gt;<i> security measure like you claim. Also please note that it is very hard
</I>&gt;<i> to write such wrappers in a secure way, such that stuff like e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> 'allowed_command foo bar ; evil_command' is not possible.
</I>
This is a very worthy remark!!! I also think that it needs quite an  
effort to script such a wrapper (and have it accepted in X2go  
upstream!!!)

&gt;&gt;<i> In pyhoca-gui a distinction can be made between an x2go system user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the end-user that is running the application. This is a good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> start, but does not solve the problem mentioned above. However if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> combined with the wrapper it is a real secure solution, as in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wrapper, the system user can only execute a number of x2go commands,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> while the end-user can only execute another set of commands.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Providing some 'nx' user which can 'su' to any user on the system is one
</I>&gt;<i> of the worst design mistakes NX made and has extremely worrying security
</I>&gt;<i> implications. But it is possible that I misunderstood your intentions.
</I>
What I have provided in PyHoca-GUI is a simple SSH proxy:

   o the first SSH/Paramiko client connects to a ,,firewall'' and sets up a
     forwarding tunnel to a system behind that firewall
   o the second SSH client connects to the forwarded port on the client's
     localhost
   o it's a cascade of
       - ssh -p &lt;fw-port&gt; &lt;fw-host&gt; -L &lt;lport&gt;:&lt;host-behind-fw-host&gt;:&lt;rport&gt;
       - x2goclient -&gt; localhost:&lt;lport&gt;
   o I use this SSH proxy option for several intranet servers I administer and
     it is a very handy-to-have feature

What Dick's company plans to do with this generic feature is:

   o provide servers with two SSH daemons running
   o one daemon IP-binds to *, the other (x2gosshd) to localhost
   o pyhoca-gui logs in to the first daemon (in the role of SSH proxy) and sets
     up a tunnel to the x2gosshd's port on localhost
   o the first daemon allows port forwarding, but no real session (via
     pam_access.so)
   o the second x2gossh daemon allows login and only grants the execution of a
     single command: the wrapper script, which Dick has been explaining about

&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Separate 	users for the x2go system calls and the end-user
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, why? What do you mean by system calls? What would be the
</I>&gt;<i> connection sequence in your scenario?
</I>
The ,,system call'' must be the first SSH login to the SSH daemon in  
proxy role...

&gt;&gt;<i> 4. A 	change to the x2go clients to accomodate this change
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5.An 	api on the server to request the allowed commands
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 6. Automatic 	generation of the configuration on the cli&#235;nt side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These points are valid, should however be discussed in a larger context:
</I>&gt;<i> Various possible future extensions require interaction between server
</I>&gt;<i> and client at session startup. E.g. when (hypothetically) doing
</I>&gt;<i> loadbalancing, the server would send load data or redirects to the
</I>&gt;<i> connecting client. Therefore a general API for such communications would
</I>&gt;<i> be useful as well as versioning within that API to provide meaningful
</I>&gt;<i> feedback when connecting with an 'old' client, or even to support
</I>&gt;<i> interaction between different client and server versions.
</I>
Something very similar I had in mind when talking about the  
x2gofeatures script, recently. I think that there will be a time when  
X2go will need such a proper handshake protocol...

However, I hope my mail gives some more information on what Dick is  
talking about...

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">PS at Dick</A>: I personally think that the subject of the original post is  
misleading and also a little discrediting. Thus, I felt so free and  
changed the subject a little...
