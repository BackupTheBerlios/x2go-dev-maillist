<PRE>Hi Tyler,

welcome on our List!

&gt;<i> Mike informed me that the x2go team is already developing browser plugins,
</I>&gt;<i> but I wanted a way to integrate a remote session into a browser using pure
</I>&gt;<i> HTML5 and JavaScript.  
</I>
His sounds very intersting!

&gt;<i> Has the x2go team significantly modified the base NX server code?  If so,
</I>&gt;<i> where can I get the full source code for the server (not just the scripts)?
</I>
So you've found the scripts in our git - the purpose of those scripts is
to initiate the needed command on server side. This means they take care
about the session management, the mounted directories, the audio
redicrection and so on. The main task is done by those needed services
and if you want to write a client on HTML/Javascript base you'll need to
contact those services too.
NX is a rendering protocol, so you wont find already rendered diff
screen segments like vnc. A real native implementation would need to
render all primitives drawn in the X screen to be converted to the HTML
Canvas Element. I've played with the Canvas Element a lot, but I always
needed some local components to do all the needed work. The result would
again be an extension for the browser which needs to be installed - like
our plugin solution. But the plugin is now a variant of x2goclient so it
won't need another code base.
But this is what I've experienced - I really would like to hear more of
your ideas about this.

What already can be done:
Use a virtual x2go display with ajaxvnc (or any other HTML VNC solution)
and access it via your browser. The occuring problem is, that you'll get
no advantages to a pure vnc environment, because the nx/x2goagent is not
displayed locally...


&gt;<i> I will mostly want to be looking at where the data gets sent to the client,
</I>&gt;<i> but I'm not sure where the best place to look for that would be.
</I>
The communication you are looking for is the communication between a
X-client and a X-server. To make it more complicated - yes in this
special case it is compressed and encrypted (ssh - I don't see how to
access ssh via javascript) too.

I really see a lot of Use Cases for such a client, because it could be
used on totally closed brickware!

So again - welcome on our list. Thank you for your interest and for
sharing you idea with us. Maybe some more time is needed, but I don't
consider this task as &quot;hopeless&quot; (as other projects are working on
similar ideas):
