<PRE>Hi Mike,

you wrote:
&gt;<i> doesn't Windows 7 have a password storage?
</I>Not that I'd know, though I am not exactly a Windows 7 expert (plus, 
Windows XP and Vista are still out there, too).
I only remember seeing a password storage function when it comes to web 
site logins in Internet Explorer.

[SNIP]

&gt;<i> Generic would also be a statement: this functionality is not supported
</I>&gt;<i> for your OS.
</I>Which would be a NX/x2go-migration-blocker for those currently using the 
&quot;store password&quot; function of the NXclient.

Again, I don't mind if you're using ssh keyfiles instead of stored 
passwords (I could drop such a keyfile into the user's home directory 
and set it up in a way that it doesn't require a password).
FWIW, you could offer to ship invisible dwarves that type the password 
on the user's keyboard and I wouldn't care. ;-)
I just need *some* way to provide a one-click (or double-click, since 
we're talking Windows here) login.

The reason behind this is a mix of usability and security issues:

Usability: The user is already authenticated on the Windows machine or 
the Windows Domain. No one else has access to the particular 
configuration file, as it is stored in the user's home directory (for 
this concept, it doesn't matter if it's a NX config file with a 
plaintext password, or a passwordless ssh secret key for x2go). There is 
absolutely no need to ask the user for a password again.

Security: While it would be possible to connect the NX or x2go server to 
the Windows Domain using PAM, keeping the two &quot;worlds&quot; seperate is a 
security benefit, since in the unlikely event that the Linux box gets 
hacked, the Windows Domain is not exposed to the attacker.

Kind Regards,
Stefan
