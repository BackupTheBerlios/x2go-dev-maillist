<PRE>Hi Angela,

you wrote:

&gt;<i> I just want to say:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WELL DONE!
</I>
Aww thank you *blush*. ;-)

&gt;<i> Thank you for the accurate and carefully worded questions and thoughts
</I>&gt;<i> and informations about X2go!
</I>Well, seems like attending A-level English classes back in school did 
pay off, then, huh? ;-)

&gt;<i> It's always great when qualified people from &quot;outside&quot; ask questions
</I>&gt;<i> and tell their view -
</I>&gt;<i> now we have lots of informations summarized in a few mails and surely
</I>&gt;<i> new ideas rising in the X2go-community
</I>
I'd call that a win-win. The thing is, I've been selling and supporting 
a FreeNX-based solution for a while, and FreeNX is starting to show its age.
Actually, the whole free-as-in-beer-but-not-free-as-in-speech stuff in 
my solution is starting to bite me hard (I'm forced to migrate away from 
several free but closed source components). So I figured that when I'm 
already forced to perform such a migration, I should replace as many 
components as possible* with FLOSS stuff. That's why I started to 
intensify my experiments with x2go, and what caused me to post my 
questions on the list - I need to find out if x2go is, or can be turned 
into, a viable alternative for FreeNX in my particular use case.

Kind Regards,
Stefan

*My dream would be a completely FLOSS-based system, but while there are 
replacements for Adobe Reader, open source Flash support is still in its 
infancy, so I can't avoid shipping Adobe Flash in the form of 
flashplugin-nonfree*.deb.

</PRE>
