<PRE>Hi John,

you wrote:
&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you are saying. Do you mean your x2go server was
</I>&gt;<i> misconfigured?
</I>*Mis*configured is a little too harsh - it was simply *not* configured, 
i.e. with a stock Debian Squeeze install, it will not work out of the box.

&gt;<i> Because I did not have to make any server configuration changes when
</I>&gt;<i> using 3.01-13 client for working sound. Then when I uninstalled
</I>&gt;<i> 3.01-13 and installed 3.01-18, sound was broken.
</I>I started my experiments with -18, so I can't say if -13 would have made 
a difference. Sorry.

-Stefan
