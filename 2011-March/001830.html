<PRE>Hi Stefan,

&gt;<i> Just a few odd comments that came to my mind after reading your reply:

YEP, good point.

&gt;<i> Regarding Univention, you wrote:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is interesting... I have been on Univention's partner summit in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Feb this year and they told me about those plans. As I know that they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are heavily Pythonian I talked to the main developer (his name was als
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Stefan, I think) about a Python API being available for X2go and left
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my contact details. I have heard from them again, so far...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Interesting indeed.
</I>
&gt;<i> Wasn't me :-D I don't work for them. Since you left your contact  
</I>&gt;<i> details, maybe you could try to contact them and try to find out?  
</I>&gt;<i> After all, if you call/e-mail them, your name might ring some bells  
</I>&gt;<i> there.
</I>
Good point, as well...

&gt;<i> If there still are legal issues regarding the x2go name, then  
</I>&gt;<i> Univention might be in for some brown stuff hitting the fan by  
</I>&gt;<i> publishing their solution and mentioning x2go - hope their legal  
</I>&gt;<i> team didn't mess that one up. Would hate seeing them drop their  
</I>&gt;<i> involvement just because of some legal fsck-up.
</I>
To dive into this (or possibly not...) Heinz needs to update us (if  
possible and sensible).

Greets,
Mike
