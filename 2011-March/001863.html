<PRE>Hi Stefan,

OK, you are thinking in migration NX2X2go-terms... I see.

SSH keyfiles are indeed possible to use with both clients.

However, neither with PyHoca-GUI nor with X2goClient-qt you have a key  
generation mechanism at hand. However, this would be really a need  
feature:

   o The client generates a key pair
   o at first login, the pubkey is pushed to the server (this needs a password)
   o at further logins, the pubkey is used for Auth...

What do you think about something like this?

&gt;<i> Usability: The user is already authenticated on the Windows machine  
</I>&gt;<i> or the Windows Domain. No one else has access to the particular  
</I>&gt;<i> configuration file, as it is stored in the user's home directory  
</I>&gt;<i> (for this concept, it doesn't matter if it's a NX config file with a  
</I>&gt;<i> plaintext password, or a passwordless ssh secret key for x2go).  
</I>&gt;<i> There is absolutely no need to ask the user for a password again.
</I>
Single-Sign-On is always a neat thing to have...

&gt;<i> Security: While it would be possible to connect the NX or x2go  
</I>&gt;<i> server to the Windows Domain using PAM, keeping the two &quot;worlds&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> seperate is a security benefit, since in the unlikely event that the  
</I>&gt;<i> Linux box gets hacked, the Windows Domain is not exposed to the  
</I>&gt;<i> attacker.
</I>
Ok, one possible approach.

Please let me known your opinion about the above approach (SSH key  
generation). It should be rather easy to implement this into Python  
X2go. If you are interested, I will add that to the PyHoca-GUI  
enhancement wishlist.

Greets,
Mike
