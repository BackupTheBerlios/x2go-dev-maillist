<PRE>Hi Mike,

[lots of important information]

I'm very happy that you took the time to write such an extensive reply. 
Most of it was indeed what I had hoped to read, for the remainder I will 
eagerly await Heinz's e-mail/post.

Just a few odd comments that came to my mind after reading your reply:
A lot of what you wrote should find its way into the FAQ or at least 
some other place on the project homepage.
That way, people know whom to contact for which aspect (re: work load 
sharing), and also where more manpower is needed (non-Ubuntu packaging, 
NX code re-write,...).

Regarding Univention, you wrote:
&gt;<i> This is interesting... I have been on Univention's partner summit in
</I>&gt;<i> Feb this year and they told me about those plans. As I know that they
</I>&gt;<i> are heavily Pythonian I talked to the main developer (his name was als
</I>&gt;<i> Stefan, I think) about a Python API being available for X2go and left
</I>&gt;<i> my contact details. I have heard from them again, so far...
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting indeed.
</I>Wasn't me :-D I don't work for them. Since you left your contact 
details, maybe you could try to contact them and try to find out? After 
all, if you call/e-mail them, your name might ring some bells there.
If there still are legal issues regarding the x2go name, then Univention 
might be in for some brown stuff hitting the fan by publishing their 
solution and mentioning x2go - hope their legal team didn't mess that 
one up. Would hate seeing them drop their involvement just because of 
some legal fsck-up.

You mentioned PyHoca-GUI and provided some download and install 
instructions; this looks like it is Linux-only, though?
The users I have in mind are using Windows on their client computers.
Now, I know Python is available for Windows, too - so would it be 
possible for you to provide a Windows-based PyHoca-GUI, just like the 
regular client?

I happen to live in the south of Germany, too, though a little more to 
the west than Heinz and Alex, too bad that you are way up North, 
otherwise I would have suggested a &quot;codefest&quot; instead of regular 
payment, some time during summer - meeting in real life, working on the 
client until it looks the way I want it to look, and the barbecue in the 
evening is on me. ;-) I happen to own a nice outdoor location for that. ;-)

For me, it would be very important that the changes I suggested are 
accepted into the mainline code - I don't want to end up with a fork 
(that could turn into a RPITA, maintenance-wise. Been there, done that, 
got the t-shirt).

Kind Regards,
Stefan
