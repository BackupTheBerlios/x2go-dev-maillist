</I>&lt;snip&gt;
Sorry, I disagree but that is a choice of development paradigm.  Take my
advice from whence it comes - I know very little about development and
the costs associated with it but I do know about managing the end user
side.  To say the user can decide assumes it is a user decision on
one-off installations for savvy users with no central administration.
Now, there may be better ways to disable the transmission of sound than
via X2Go but, in my limited development experience, I've always tried to
admit that I may not be able to foresee every possible plausible user
case and thus try to provide more rather than fewer options.

These are not absurd user cases and they are not fostered by a business
model (in fact, I really didn't appreciate that comment but I may have
taken it the wrong way).  They are fostered by real world working
experiences where sound may be undesirable.  Again, there are probably
better ways to do this than via X2Go as I mentioned in my original
comment but I cannot foresee all cases and there may be a time when it
is better to handle it from X2Go.  Thanks - John
