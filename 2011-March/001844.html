During the redesign of x2goclient we've integrated all needed changes so
that x2goclient can be used as plugin. We will start to add the needed
files and configuration for a firefox plugin first. It will be possible
to support chrome, konqueror and internet explorer later too.
For all people evaluating the first plugin: the server.x2go file will be
dropped. All configurations will be provided in the html file containing
the plugin (We're aware that some of you really liked the seperated file
architecture, but it won't be possible).

Some words about the future and the future of tomorrow:

IN MY EYES...

...in the next years more and more commodities/appliances/devices will
be introduced and there will be a decreasing number of compatible
platforms. An increasing number will be &quot;bricked by design&quot; depended to
a censored store so the only generic runtime environment will be a web
browser.
Again and again people are asking for an ApplePad client, already
knowing about our (or better: apples) problems to offer it reliable.
So yes - it is a good idea to have an eye on that topic and we do so.
There are really some interesting &quot;ajax&quot; VNC implementations on the net,
but at the moment, only capturing protocols can be adopted.
Some day in the future it will turn out, that the bloated javascript
widget libraries can't be adopted or maintained to all plattforms. Even
if you try hard - applications published this way will look different on
different devices and can be easily destroyed by browser modifications.
And don't forget about security issues (javascript links wont show you
their target server in the status bar if it is a javascript function).
So the canvas element and the webgl canvas will/can become more and more
popular. Maybe the rendering capabilities will become sufficient enough
to become a real alternative to a framebuffer.

But at the moment XOrg is a very good base as it offers caching
features, local device support as it was build to offer native network
transparency.

Regards,

Heinz
