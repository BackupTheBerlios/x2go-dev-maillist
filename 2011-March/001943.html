</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ACK!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; - then again, some other user may have a use case where it

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the X2Go server - John
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No you are generating absurd use-cases. One shouldn't have to use x2go
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to enforce this. And then again the right way of doing this is to forbid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> remote pulse-audio connections locally!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have the feeling that these requests are not to support x2go, but to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be able to enforce a business-model (For sound you have to pay 10 bucks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extra). But what do I care, as long as this is optional and having such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a handshake is optional......
</I>
&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I disagree but that is a choice of development paradigm.  Take my
</I>&gt;<i> advice from whence it comes - I know very little about development and
</I>&gt;<i> the costs associated with it but I do know about managing the end user
</I>&gt;<i> side.  To say the user can decide assumes it is a user decision on
</I>&gt;<i> one-off installations for savvy users with no central administration.
</I>&gt;<i> Now, there may be better ways to disable the transmission of sound than
</I>&gt;<i> via X2Go but, in my limited development experience, I've always tried to
</I>&gt;<i> admit that I may not be able to foresee every possible plausible user
</I>&gt;<i> case and thus try to provide more rather than fewer options.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are not absurd user cases and they are not fostered by a business
</I>&gt;<i> model (in fact, I really didn't appreciate that comment but I may have
</I>&gt;<i> taken it the wrong way).  They are fostered by real world working
</I>&gt;<i> experiences where sound may be undesirable.  Again, there are probably
</I>&gt;<i> better ways to do this than via X2Go as I mentioned in my original
</I>&gt;<i> comment but I cannot foresee all cases and there may be a time when it
</I>&gt;<i> is better to handle it from X2Go.  Thanks - John
</I>
I'd also like to see rather more than less features and quite an  
amount of flexibility in X2go.

I think X2go is a piece of software that can have many different use  
cases and none is less worth than another. We should make sure that we  
- as developers - work in such a generic way that we meet requirements  
of a broad mass of people. If we need a very special feature for our  
own use case, let's find abstraction layers to make the code as  
generic and flexible as possible...

That is: A ,,No - we (personally) do not need this feature'' should  
not end up in: ,,No - we will not include this feature''.

Greets,
Mike
