<PRE>Hi John,

you wrote:

 &gt;&gt; 6) Is there any way to get sound working (especially in rootless mode,
 &gt;&gt; say, for Flash-based websites displayed in a remote Firefox/Iceweasel
 &gt;&gt; window) with Debian lenny or squeeze on the server side, and Windows
 &gt;&gt; on the client side? I've seen a few messages concerning sound issues
 &gt;&gt; in the list archives, but I'm not sure if I made a mistake during my
 &gt;&gt; test installation or if there is a general problem and I can stop
 &gt;&gt; banging my head against the wall until the developers declare that the
 &gt;&gt; issue is fixed.
&lt;snip&gt;
 &gt;Sound is working nicely for us in Windows out of the box.  We did need
 &gt;to use the Squeeze pulseaudio packages on the server side - John

I'm running Sqeeze as my test system, tried both esound and pulseaudio, 
but I have no sound when playing youtube videos in a rootless Iceweasel 
(Firefox) window.

No full Gnome or KDE desktop environment installed, so not sure if it 
would work with a fullscreen session.

Client: X2Go Client 3.01-18, Windows 7 Home Premium

Any ideas?

Kind Regards,
Stefan Baur
