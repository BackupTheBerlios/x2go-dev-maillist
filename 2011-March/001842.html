<PRE>Hello Stefan,

Am 02.03.2011 13:55, schrieb Stefan Baur:
&gt;<i> Hi list,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have been &quot;playing&quot; with x2go for a while and it looks very promising
</I>&gt;<i> - a worthy successor to Nomachine NX - though I am unsure about a few
</I>&gt;<i> things - maybe someone here on this list could provide some information?
</I>
Thank you for your commendation - I'll try to answer your questions.

&gt;<i> My questions are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) With the recent announcement of Nomachine going closed source, what
</I>&gt;<i> does the future of x2go look like?
</I>
As far as I know all Open Source components (existing or build in
future) will still be available on CD (if you ask them).

&gt;<i> 1a) As far as I understand, x2go uses parts of the GPL'ed Nomachine
</I>&gt;<i> code, which will remain available in its current state due to the GPL,
</I>&gt;<i> but will not be maintained by Nomachine any more. Are the x2go
</I>&gt;<i> developers willing - and able - to maintain this part of the code, in
</I>&gt;<i> case it requires maintenance and / or security patches?
</I>&gt;<i> 1b) Or are you going to do a re-write of the Nomachine code currently
</I>&gt;<i> in use?
</I>
The used used XOrg code isn't maintained since a long time. The only way
to get this construction supportable would be porting the functionality
as modules to a recent XOrg Version. We've been talking about this for a
very long time now. This all should be possible, but would take a lot of
time. It would be a decision about neglecting other parts of x2go for
some time. As Mike already mentioned, it will be a good idea to collect
some people to do this task.

I would suggest to discuss this topic after baikal (upcoming release) is
released.

&gt;<i> So I
</I>&gt;<i> was wondering if there is a sufficient amount of other people backing
</I>&gt;<i> the project that the loss of the lead developer (be it due to increased
</I>&gt;<i> workload at his day job, health issues, or simply loss of interest) can
</I>&gt;<i> be dealt with, should the situation arise? If that isn't the case right
</I>&gt;<i> now, I would like to suggest making plans for it asap - the best time to
</I>&gt;<i> install a fire escape ladder is before the house has a chance to start
</I>&gt;<i> burning. ;-)
</I>
In the past we've been two people developing x2go and at the moment Alex
and I ares still interested in x2go. But during the last year more and
more people have been joined this list and we now have a usable python
client. X2go uses a lot of generic linux based projects (fuse, udev,
ssh, cups,...), which are maintained by themselves.

&gt;<i> 2) I read that Univention is using x2go for their desktop virtualization
</I>&gt;<i> (see
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://wiki.univention.de/index.php?title=UCS_Desktop_Virtualization_Services">http://wiki.univention.de/index.php?title=UCS_Desktop_Virtualization_Services</A>&gt;).
</I>&gt;<i> Are they active supporters of x2go (i.e. donating money or manpower to
</I>&gt;<i> the project)?
</I>&gt;<i> (I ask because I'm hoping that a company planning a large-scale
</I>&gt;<i> commerial deployment like Univention seems to be doing would have an
</I>&gt;<i> interest in the x2go project staying alive and expanding.)
</I>
I didn't even know that they are using x2go. There were some contacts in
the past, but it was never mentioned that x2go would be a component of ucs.

&gt;<i> 3) I heard of legal issues regarding the project name and some other
</I>&gt;<i> stuff. That was back in December. Since the project is still named x2go,
</I>&gt;<i> and Univention is openly using this name, I was wondering if these
</I>&gt;<i> issues have been resolved?
</I>
Yes and no, there is still a person left who claims x2go as
&quot;werktitelschutz&quot;. A new name is the way to go if this problem can't be
solved.

&gt;<i> 4) Browsing the list archive, I saw that you are planning to provide
</I>&gt;<i> packages for sid and wheezy via the official Debian repositories...
</I>
Mike answered this question before - all packaging topics will be
discussed and announced on the packaging mailing list.

&gt;<i> 5) I understand that you need some sort of full-screen application
</I>&gt;<i> (similar to xdm/kdm/gdm) when running in thin client mode, and that this
</I>&gt;<i> is why the current x2go client looks the way it looks, but I would
</I>&gt;<i> really like to see a client that doesn't take up as much screen space,
</I>&gt;<i> especially on Windows.
</I>
There are typically 3 Use Cases of x2goclient:

1.) You are sysop or supporter and you are required to have a lot of
sessions preconfigured. X1go will offer you a interface with easy
session management and search feature.

2.) You are a user of a device running the TCE (thin client
environment). You'll need to have a display manager to log into your
session.

3.) You are a desktop user and you only need one session configured.
Often the sysop has configured x2goclient using the &quot;hidden mode&quot; in
this case. This means, you only have an icon of the session/remote
application and if you use this desktop symbol, the remote application
will be started without showing x2goclient.

&gt;<i> Would it be possible to add an option for a &quot;smaller&quot; login window,
</I>&gt;<i> similar to the one used by the current NX client:
</I>
Yes it would be possible - but it is not on our list for the upcoming
release. We already have been accepting to much features so baikal is
delayed more than we've expected. As Mike has already introduced his
solution: maybe pyhoca is an option.

&gt;<i>  when the session file was
</I>&gt;<i> stored with a password, directly start the login process?
</I>
Maybe it is a better idea to work on a more usable solution for key
authentication.

&gt;<i> Regarding question 5, I cannot provide patches myself, as I am not a
</I>&gt;<i> coder, but I would be willing to make a financial contribution either to
</I>&gt;<i> the x2go project, if it is possible for them to accept such
</I>&gt;<i> contributions, or to the coder providing the necessary patches (as long
</I>&gt;<i> as the price quote seems reasonable and affordable to me) - if that
</I>&gt;<i> helps motivate you to code. ;-)
</I>
It is very easy for us (I think I can speak for Mike too) to offer and
accept &quot;orders - especially if the result can be used as part of the
mainstream distribution. Donations are somewhat critical, as they are
not addressed to a supply of service or product (as we need to pay tax
on the spend money).

Thank you for your mail and your questions. This way we've summarized a
lot of things into one place.

Regards,

Heinz
