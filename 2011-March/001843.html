<PRE>Hej Stefan,

I just want to say:

WELL DONE!

Thank you for the accurate and carefully worded questions and thoughts  
and informations about X2go!

It's always great when qualified people from &quot;outside&quot; ask questions  
and tell their view -
now we have lots of informations summarized in a few mails and surely  
new ideas rising in the X2go-community.

Angela



Zitat von &quot;Heinz-M. Graesing&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">x2go-dev at x2go.org</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> Hello Stefan,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Am 02.03.2011 13:55, schrieb Stefan Baur:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi list,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have been &quot;playing&quot; with x2go for a while and it looks very promising
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - a worthy successor to Nomachine NX - though I am unsure about a few
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things - maybe someone here on this list could provide some information?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your commendation - I'll try to answer your questions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My questions are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) With the recent announcement of Nomachine going closed source, what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does the future of x2go look like?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I know all Open Source components (existing or build in
</I>&gt;<i> future) will still be available on CD (if you ask them).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1a) As far as I understand, x2go uses parts of the GPL'ed Nomachine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code, which will remain available in its current state due to the GPL,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but will not be maintained by Nomachine any more. Are the x2go
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developers willing - and able - to maintain this part of the code, in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> case it requires maintenance and / or security patches?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1b) Or are you going to do a re-write of the Nomachine code currently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in use?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The used used XOrg code isn't maintained since a long time. The only way
</I>&gt;<i> to get this construction supportable would be porting the functionality
</I>&gt;<i> as modules to a recent XOrg Version. We've been talking about this for a
</I>&gt;<i> very long time now. This all should be possible, but would take a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> time. It would be a decision about neglecting other parts of x2go for
</I>&gt;<i> some time. As Mike already mentioned, it will be a good idea to collect
</I>&gt;<i> some people to do this task.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would suggest to discuss this topic after baikal (upcoming release) is
</I>&gt;<i> released.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was wondering if there is a sufficient amount of other people backing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the project that the loss of the lead developer (be it due to increased
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> workload at his day job, health issues, or simply loss of interest) can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be dealt with, should the situation arise? If that isn't the case right
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now, I would like to suggest making plans for it asap - the best time to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> install a fire escape ladder is before the house has a chance to start
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> burning. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the past we've been two people developing x2go and at the moment Alex
</I>&gt;<i> and I ares still interested in x2go. But during the last year more and
</I>&gt;<i> more people have been joined this list and we now have a usable python
</I>&gt;<i> client. X2go uses a lot of generic linux based projects (fuse, udev,
</I>&gt;<i> ssh, cups,...), which are maintained by themselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) I read that Univention is using x2go for their desktop virtualization
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://wiki.univention.de/index.php?title=UCS_Desktop_Virtualization_Services">http://wiki.univention.de/index.php?title=UCS_Desktop_Virtualization_Services</A>&gt;).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are they active supporters of x2go (i.e. donating money or manpower to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the project)?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (I ask because I'm hoping that a company planning a large-scale
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commerial deployment like Univention seems to be doing would have an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interest in the x2go project staying alive and expanding.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't even know that they are using x2go. There were some contacts in
</I>&gt;<i> the past, but it was never mentioned that x2go would be a component of ucs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) I heard of legal issues regarding the project name and some other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stuff. That was back in December. Since the project is still named x2go,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and Univention is openly using this name, I was wondering if these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issues have been resolved?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes and no, there is still a person left who claims x2go as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;werktitelschutz&quot;. A new name is the way to go if this problem can't be
</I>&gt;<i> solved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4) Browsing the list archive, I saw that you are planning to provide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> packages for sid and wheezy via the official Debian repositories...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mike answered this question before - all packaging topics will be
</I>&gt;<i> discussed and announced on the packaging mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5) I understand that you need some sort of full-screen application
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (similar to xdm/kdm/gdm) when running in thin client mode, and that this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is why the current x2go client looks the way it looks, but I would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really like to see a client that doesn't take up as much screen space,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> especially on Windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are typically 3 Use Cases of x2goclient:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.) You are sysop or supporter and you are required to have a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> sessions preconfigured. X1go will offer you a interface with easy
</I>&gt;<i> session management and search feature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.) You are a user of a device running the TCE (thin client
</I>&gt;<i> environment). You'll need to have a display manager to log into your
</I>&gt;<i> session.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.) You are a desktop user and you only need one session configured.
</I>&gt;<i> Often the sysop has configured x2goclient using the &quot;hidden mode&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i> this case. This means, you only have an icon of the session/remote
</I>&gt;<i> application and if you use this desktop symbol, the remote application
</I>&gt;<i> will be started without showing x2goclient.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Would it be possible to add an option for a &quot;smaller&quot; login window,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> similar to the one used by the current NX client:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes it would be possible - but it is not on our list for the upcoming
</I>&gt;<i> release. We already have been accepting to much features so baikal is
</I>&gt;<i> delayed more than we've expected. As Mike has already introduced his
</I>&gt;<i> solution: maybe pyhoca is an option.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  when the session file was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stored with a password, directly start the login process?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe it is a better idea to work on a more usable solution for key
</I>&gt;<i> authentication.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regarding question 5, I cannot provide patches myself, as I am not a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> coder, but I would be willing to make a financial contribution either to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the x2go project, if it is possible for them to accept such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contributions, or to the coder providing the necessary patches (as long
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as the price quote seems reasonable and affordable to me) - if that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> helps motivate you to code. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is very easy for us (I think I can speak for Mike too) to offer and
</I>&gt;<i> accept &quot;orders - especially if the result can be used as part of the
</I>&gt;<i> mainstream distribution. Donations are somewhat critical, as they are
</I>&gt;<i> not addressed to a supply of service or product (as we need to pay tax
</I>&gt;<i> on the spend money).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your mail and your questions. This way we've summarized a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of things into one place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Heinz
