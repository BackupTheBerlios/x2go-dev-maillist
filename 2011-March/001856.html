Clarifications:

a) my name is spelled 'Reinhard'

b) I don't &quot;do&quot; the ubuntu packaging, nor will &quot;Uni Erlangen&quot; do
something what you state.  I'm both a Debian Developer and Ubuntu
Developer and think the work is better spent on having the package first
in Debian proper, as Ubuntu basically has similar requirements and there
is an straight forward process that copies packages from Debian to
Ubuntu. Since it's creation about 5 weeks ago, I'm the only one who has
actually contributed something substantial to the 'official' Debian x2go
packaging team: an almost ready x2goclient package suitable for
inclusion into the main Debian archive:

<A HREF="http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-x2go-devel/2011-January/000000.html">http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-x2go-devel/2011-January/000000.html</A>

However, it has still neither found their way to the designated git
branches in collab-maint on alioth.debian.org, nor to the Debian archive.

Moreover, I'm surprised (not to say irritated) that while Jonas welcomed
me to the team, your mail (the one I'm replying to right now) clearly
states otherwise.

c) As a proof of concept and development environment for our internal
x2go test-deployment, I have built an integration archive that builds
daily packages from the development branches at
<A HREF="http://i4git.informatik.uni-erlangen.de.">http://i4git.informatik.uni-erlangen.de.</A>  This is mainly for easily and
quickly testing developments. Currently, it ships a working x2goserver,
x2goclient and x2gognomebindings for ubuntu/lucid and ubuntu/natty.

I'd suggest to create a team PPA for the newly created x2go team in
launchpad and move the packages there.

The packaging there (and the same BTW applies to the branches at
code.x2go.org) is in no way &quot;clean&quot; and as such, not suitable for proper
inclusion into neither Debian and Ubuntu. TBH, I think there is a
considerable amount of cleanup work to be done (like, writing proper
installation scripts in makefiles, etc.) before we can even consider
packaging it properly.
