<PRE>I am developing a way to pipe NX over HTTP (client and NodeJS server
module), and I noticed that x2go is a full-featured solution based on NX
technology.  I already asked about this on the users mailing list and I was
directed here by Mike Gabriel.  I'll try to not repeat anything that was
already answered.

Mike informed me that the x2go team is already developing browser plugins,
but I wanted a way to integrate a remote session into a browser using pure
HTML5 and JavaScript.  Anyway, my question has more to do with the
underlying NX server source.

Has the x2go team significantly modified the base NX server code?  If so,
where can I get the full source code for the server (not just the scripts)?
 Mike led me to this website: <A HREF="http://i4git.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/,">http://i4git.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/,</A> but
I wasn't able to figure out how to clone the repositories.  I don't mean to
be too forward, especially since I'm new to this list, but has the x2go team
considered using a free code sharing site like GitHub?

I will mostly want to be looking at where the data gets sent to the client,
but I'm not sure where the best place to look for that would be.

Thank you so much for your help!
