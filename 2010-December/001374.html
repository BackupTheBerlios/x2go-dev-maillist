<PRE>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> I admit to not reading this carefully as I am running out the door but
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't one also need to be a member of fuse (file sharing) and pulse,
</I>&gt;<i> pulse-access, and pulse-rt? - John
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Ok, after my final investigations, it seems problem with the escape of &quot;@&quot;
which is changed to DOMAIN&quot;\&quot;User. Everything else is the same. Only, only
pulseaudio ssh forward doesn't happen. I have found this inside
/var/log/syslog:

Dec 14 16:01:43 bgtrmx02 pulseaudio[11757]: pid.c: Failed to open PID file
'/home/likewise-open/DOMAIN/iboyadzi/.pulse/512381a4f3b57a9260ac14f100000005-runtime/pid':
No such file or directory
Dec 14 16:01:43 bgtrmx02 pulseaudio[11757]: pid.c: Failed to open PID file
'/home/likewise-open/DOMAIN/iboyadzi/.pulse/512381a4f3b57a9260ac14f100000005-runtime/pid':
No such file or directory

- I've compared 2 newly created user folders (local and LDAP). There had
differences:
 * media symlink to /tmp/DOMAIN\USER_media wasn't successful for LDAP user
 * LDAP user has .pulse folder with the pid error above
 * local user has .pulse-client.conf and .pulse-cookie inside
~/.x2go/C-Username...dp32/

- ps axwww compare showed no difference

The point with LDAP user logged in locally, has same effect as changing
/dev/snd/* files permissions to 0666 (SUBSYSTEM==&quot;sound&quot;, MODE=&quot;0666&quot; part),
and thus the sound is hearing on the server side.

My questions:
1. Do you know how this SSH Pulseaudio forwarding is implemented. I would
like to try to create manually a new pulseaudio forwarding to current remote
LDAP account session.
2. Can you show me where in the sources, are the parts written both for the
server and client side. When I get more deep understanding how this
pulseaudio is happening I would provide exact reason why it fails.

Thanks and Best Regards
Ivan
