I am quite sure you meant something totally different than what you 
wrote there... ;-)

&gt;<i> all, it is a contribution to X2go.

I don't like censorship at all. IMHO it would be a bad precedent to 
censor someone's mails because they express unpopular views.

&gt;<i> AND: this list is for discussing about development issues around X2go,

</I>
Well, you can't stop a thread on a public mailing list by pronouncing 
you are the only one entitled to an opinion. Of course you can ignore 
any follow-ups (which can be quite tough ;-).

Best regards,
Erik
