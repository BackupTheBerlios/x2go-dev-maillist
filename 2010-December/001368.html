<PRE>Hmm . . . I do not know the answer.  We are using LDAP authentication

&gt;<i> and it is working well (RedHat Directory Server).  We are using local
</I>&gt;<i> groups but the members are defined in LDAP.  However, we are using uid
</I>&gt;<i> to identify the user rather than email so your hunch about the unescaped
</I>&gt;<i> characters might be correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The connections are really provided by ssh.  What happens if you try to
</I>&gt;<i> establish a simple ssh connection using the <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">username at domain</A> rather than
</I>&gt;<i> x2go? - John
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Thanks for your reply John,

We are using Windows LDAP, which is in productive for Windows Terminal
Server. Now I'm testing migration to x2go. Thus, we can't replace the
current LDAP server. And all groups are defined in LDAP. They are visible
when logged in with LDAP credentials, and the group ids are 10 digit
numbers. However. I have little update on my investigations.

Issue 1: Summary from my update:
- remote login LDAP account - no sound.
- when login locally with same LDAP account, the sound is there - both in
remote and local places.
- still the sound comes out from the Server computer only, wherever it has
been started from (started music on remote x2go, gives the sound getting out
the server)

Update: Now I have added the following rows in:
/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
SUBSYSTEM==&quot;sound&quot;, GROUP=&quot;pulse&quot; #tested with audio as well
SUBSYSTEM==&quot;sound&quot;, MODE=&quot;0666&quot;

the result is: there is sound when logged only once with remote LDAP
connection (no need of local login any more!), still the sound gets out from
the Server PC only.

Then I continued investigations: logged remotely both to Local Account (the
desired behaviour) and LDAP Account (both with sound):
- alsamixer gives absolutely same result - audio is pulseaudio
- gnome-volume-control gives different result
   * for Local Account: Nothing in Hardware; Output is Windows waveOut PCM
(or client speaker)
   * for LDAP Account: Server sound card in Hardware; Output is Internal
Audio Analog (again on the server)

   ** Update: LDAP Account with no sound: Nothing in Hardware; Output is
Dummy Output; alsamixer returns same pulseaudio sound device

Bottom line so far: remote login with Local Ubuntu User - sound is forwarded
to client; remote login with LDAP User - sound is not forwarded, but played
on the Server

Issue 2: You are completely right. It is ssh related. I've read about the
issue, and tried the suggested MaxAuthTries equal to 24, but then other
error has been returned. I'm currently reading for better solution, along
with checking the log /var/log/auth.log for more detailed information.
Still I use windows client, and I can't use ssh-add -D for deleting the
cache. I'm searching for equivalent there.

Bottom line: my solution with deleting sql session file has nothing to do
with this. It is ssh number of tries.

Thanks for you reply, I am continuing working over the issues. Please, share
if you have some thoughts about this update.

Best Regards
Ivan
