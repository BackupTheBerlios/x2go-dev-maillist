<PRE>
I am actually struggling with the exact scenario as Ivan is involved with here. Unfortunately, I'm not quite to where you are yet, so according to you more troubles loom on the horizon re: audio. We are trying to use x2go with Likewise Open connected to our corporate Active Directory and based upon your suggestion here, I've changed the id of the local group x2gousers to my LDAP group ID for x2gousers group in our corporate groups, in /etc/group and now my users in my LDAP group are able to authenticate successfully.

However, when connecting as an LDAP user via Likewise, I only get a blank/black screen upon session start. The session is active and shows as being connected (I see the user listed when I run &quot;who&quot;), but I can't do or see anything in that user's x2go session window. Whereas when I use a local user, it brings me right to a GNOME desktop and I can use it as normal with full audio. If you can help me figure this out, I can move onto the next issue which will be getting audio for Likewise LDAP users, which I see is where Ivan is stuck now as well. If we can get these last two issues resolved, we intend to roll this out on a much larger scale at our organization as well as demo it to a much larger audience at our parent company.

Thanks,
Neil
