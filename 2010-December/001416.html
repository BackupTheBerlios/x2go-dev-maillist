<PRE>Hi again,

I will push for a fix, as it seems I had same localuser on the server side.
Everytime I logged in with my LDAP password actually logged me into the home
folder of the user with all LDAP permission groups (still that was
/home/USER and no domain was in the path). The sound was always present,
file sharing, suspend, and terminate. Now, when I've removed the local user,
and tested, even when I'm with default domain and Likewise-open 6, the user
is getting created under /home/local/DOMAIN/User folder, and the username is
again with DOMAIN\User and again: no sound, no file share, no session
resume, even no session terminate.

Can you, please, check and give us some estimation of the fix? Sorry to push
you, but now for each username that is in my LDAP i had to create dummy
local account with whatever password or to create manually entry in
/etc/passwd file in order to create the account without DOMAIN name. This is
again manual efforts and makes x2go un-centralised. The fix should come
sooner or later, better sooner.

P.S. In case you are busy, can you, please, send me instructions how you
build the client for windows (I had already downloaded the qt for windows).
This way I could debug the exact parameters that are send and fix the code,
I could even provide patch (in a way of .diff), and build the code locally

Best Regards
Ivan
