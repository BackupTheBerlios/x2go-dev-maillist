<PRE>Hi,
I've implemented x2go with likewise-open, still I do have 2 issues, which
are present only when I use LDAP account, and not present with regular
account on the linux. More details: OS Ubuntu 10.10; x2go 3.0.1-5;
likewise-open 5.4.0.42111. Ubuntu is joined to Windows Active Directory
through LDAP. I don't have any issues there, and everything work fine with
this configuration (one issue that I've overcome: when joining LDAP, the
users have other group IDs, which came from LDAP. In order to connect to
x2go server, your username must have the x2gousers group assignment. In my
case in LDAP I do have special group which contains users who have to have
access. I've logged to LDAP locally on the ubuntu, and using command id I've
checked the unique identification of that LDAP group. Then I've set this
number to the x2gousers in the file /etx/groups. This way I overwrite the
group that came from LDAP with the local group, and only these users can
connect to x2go).

Note: I've read all the documentation and I still didn't find solutions for
my issues. They are:

1. Connecting remotely with x2go client with LDAP credentials doesn't
forward sound - thus no sound can be heard. This problem doesn't occur when
I login locally on the Ubuntu with same LDAP credentials. When I'm logged in
locally, the next remote login (using the client), has sound. However, I
thought that it is something with groups for audio, but seems it is not, as
I'm using very same credentials and the only difference is local and remote,
this way all user permissions are same (confirmed)...
2. Connecting remotely with x2go client with LDAP credentials doesn't stop
the session, when disconnected in every way. The session remain open
(visible with x2golistsessions_sql HOSTNAME). I've made around 20 client
sessions from one host, and on the next ones it refused to connect me,
because the number of authentications were too much. Again, when doing this
locally on the Ubuntu, the sessions really terminate. I've even replaced
x2gosuspend with x2goterminate, without any success. The only way is to
delete file /var/db/x2go/x2go_sessions and to create empty one with
/usr/lib/x2go/script/x2gosqlite.sh. The live sessions still remain active,
but this doesn't seem good solution. It is not possible to terminate or to
resume open sessions with the client as well. So they stay like zombies
there.

Do you have an idea what can be the root causes for these issues? My logic
lead me to some un-escaped symbols used when joining the Domain - like @ and
\. Because when logging to the LDAP I am using <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">USERNAME at DOMAIN.</A> Another
possibility is to be from Likewise-open, still, there should not happen this
as locally everything works fine.

Best Regards
Ivan
