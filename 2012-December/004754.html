</I>Hello Mike, thanks for being aware of this issue.
These are the software versions of the x2go software I'm enjoying:
x2goserver 3.1.1.4-2
x2goclient 3.99.2.2-1

Regarding pyhoca-* I was kindly pointed to the x2go website by another IRC
user to learn about it and since it isn't already packaged in my GNU/Linux
distribution (Arch Linux) I was planning to add it; however some errors at
compile time what I don't have the time right now to debug[0] made it
impossible to install &amp; run the application.
Please let me know if you need further feedback from my part.

[0] From the glimpse I gave to the errors it seems it's related to the way
Python 2 is packaged here in Arch, being named /usr/bin/python2 in contrast
to most other distros (and Python 3 /usr/bin/python) and thus breaking
compatibility with all the Python 2 scripts created outside AL. This issue
is really easy to resolve, I just need a couple of free hours to figure it
out and test that everything works okay and then I will pack pyhoca for
Arch.
