<PRE>Hi Reinhard,

What you propose is to introduce a completely new security policy:
&gt;<i> everyone in a certain group 'netdev' may change everything. This may
</I>&gt;<i> be appropriate in your scenario, but may not be in others. For
</I>&gt;<i> instance, have you considered what other packages &quot;use&quot; the netdev
</I>&gt;<i> group? Are you fully aware about the consequences in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> additional privileges users gain by being put in that group? Moreover,
</I>&gt;<i> in a managed environment, where all users are in a network directory
</I>&gt;<i> such as NIS or LDAP, it is not that simple to add a user to a
</I>&gt;<i> computer-local group, as the group may have a different group ID on
</I>&gt;<i> different machines. Such scenarios are not uncommon for larger x2go
</I>&gt;<i> deployments at all!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The netdev group change is not a proposal for something I think should be
included in X2Go, more like &quot;if someone has the same issue, I got it
working by doing this&quot;. I agree that adding the netdev group is not ideal
from a security perspective, someone who fully understands what's going on
could probably come up with a much safer solution.

Cheers,
Daniel
