<PRE>

[Note that I removed dev and submit from the send list and just kept <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">77 at bugs</A>, for right or wrong...]

Thank you Stefan for your valuable advice, and I am sorry about the delay.

I can now state the following.

State 0: No cygwin or x2go running, presumably no cygwin1.dll loaded/active.

State 1: cygwin running, cmd.exe -&gt; bash.exe -&gt; cygwin1.dll version 1001.8.0.0 (Wed Jan 31 16:09:39 2001). No x2go running.

State 2: x2go running, x2goclient.exe -&gt; sshd.exe -&gt; cygwin1.dll version 1005.25.0.0 (Thu Jun 12 19:35:47 2008). No cygwin running.

State 3: Both cygwin and x2go running.
Process Viewer still reports
cmd.exe -&gt; bash.exe -&gt; cygwin1.dll version 1001.8.0.0
x2goclient.exe -&gt; sshd.exe -&gt; cygwin1.dll version 1005.25.0.0
(So it seems different versions can be active simultaneously...)

Repeatably, when I go from state 0 to 2,
x2goclient causes its directories to be mounted in the cygwin environment;
this remains in effect (stored in registry) until it is manually unmounted using umount in cmd.exe.
Cygwin (bash.exe) is now crippled if it is started because fundamental commands are not found.

When I go from state 0 to 1 and then to 3, this does not happen,
and as far as I can see, x2go works fine anyway.
So I use this strategy as workaround.

I hope this was helpful.

Regards,
Anders

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What happens is that directories from the X2Go installation are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suddenly mounted as /etc and /bin in CygWin.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since fundamental commands such as &quot;/bin/ls&quot; are thereby missing,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nothing works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After this fix, I can still use X2Go without problems and without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the mounts coming back, so I just cannot see why the mounts were
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; necessary in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sometimes, however, the harmful mounts do come back.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I cannot pinpoint exactly when this happens,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but at least it is not every time I restart the computer and not every
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time I run X2Go.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is this known?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Could some developer explain what is happening?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, X2Go uses some Cygwin code for its Windows client.
</I>&gt;<i> I've seen weird things happen before when two applications brought their
</I>&gt;<i> own set of Cygwin libraries and they belonged to different versions,
</I>&gt;<i> maybe this is a similar issue.
</I>&gt;<i> Probably something like whoever loads cygwin1.dll first &quot;wins&quot;, the
</I>&gt;<i> other application is blocked from loading its own version of cygwin1.dll
</I>&gt;<i> and just has to make do with whatever cygwin1.dll is already in memory.
</I>&gt;<i>   After that, it's either an application from the old Cygwin failing
</I>&gt;<i> because the newer cygwin1.dll is doing something unexpected, or it's a
</I>&gt;<i> new application failing because the old cygwin1.dll doesn't offer the
</I>&gt;<i> function that it is expecting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, to debug this issue, it would be interesting to see what happens
</I>&gt;<i> when you first run X2GoClient and keep it in the background, then try to
</I>&gt;<i> rund your old Cygwin applications, and what happens when you run your
</I>&gt;<i> old applications first (keeping at least one window of them open) and
</I>&gt;<i> start X2GoClient afterwards.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, be aware that it is wrong to assume that all X2Go tasks have been
</I>&gt;<i> terminated just because you don't see an X2Go icon in your task bar.
</I>&gt;<i> Running task manager after closing X2GoClient, you may still encounter a
</I>&gt;<i> running pulseaudio, sshd and/or vcxsrv on your Windows client.
</I>&gt;<i> If you see these, terminete them from within task manager before running
</I>&gt;<i> your old cygwin applications and see if that helps.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not suggesting that this is the solution to your problem, but I am
</I>&gt;<i> sure the results will be helpful for the devs to pinpoint the issue.
