Ugh! Make that 2 to 3 seconds between down arrow and response!!!!

I tried to resume a session I had suspended from Linux but it complained
about a mismatched color depth.  I checked my Windows laptop and,
indeed, it was set to 16 bit color.  I changed it to 32 bit color and
performance has gone through the floor - John
