<PRE>Hi John,

x2goagent/nxagent runs on the X2go server, not at all on the client!!!  
What comes with x2goclient/PyHoca-GUI are:

   nxproxy.exe + libxcomp3 + some cygwin stuff
   pulseaudio.exe
   vcxsrv.exe (a complete vcxsrv installation in case of PyHoca-GUI, a minimal
       set of files in case of x2goclient)

&gt;<i> On the other hand, reverting to 3.0.1-4 did not fix the problem
</I>&gt;<i> which has me very suspicious.  I am writing from Linux right now but I
</I>&gt;<i> will test that again later.  If it is not the nxagent or the 3.99
</I>&gt;<i> client, then we'll need to find whatever it was that Pyhoca pulled in.
</I>
Everything that PyHoca-GUI installs ends up in  
%ProgramFiles%\PyHoca-GUI. Erase that dir and you should be clean again.

&gt;<i> I did uninstall ghostscript and vcxsrv after uninstalling Pyhoca.
</I>
Ok...

&gt;<i> I can confirm that the problem persists even after backleveling to
</I>&gt;<i> 3.0.1-4 so I'm not sure that this is specifically 3.99 but it is a
</I>&gt;<i> crippling problem.
</I>
:<i>-(
</I>
&gt;<i> On to the actual problem.  We normally use 16m-png-jpeg packing which
</I>&gt;<i> seems to give us the fastest performance and crispest looking screen on
</I>&gt;<i> our WAN only environment.
</I>
I can confirm the performance improvement when running pyhoca-gui and  
x2goclient on Linux.

&gt;<i> I'm honestly not sure what this setting
</I>&gt;<i> controls.  I assume it means we are compressing png and jpeg images as
</I>&gt;<i> opposed to the default 16m-jpeg which then only compresses jpegs? I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know what the 16m is - is that the size of the cache?
</I>
No clue, actually. That is NX stuff...

&gt;<i> When we use that from a Windows client now, all the images are
</I>&gt;<i> thoroughly corrupted and unusable.  This was noticeable in the desktop
</I>&gt;<i> icons and in the KDE splash screen.  We changed the packing to 16m-jpeg
</I>&gt;<i> and thought the problem went away because the splash screen and desktop
</I>&gt;<i> icons appeared properly.  Our enthusiasm was short-lived.  All jpegs
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be corrupt.  The only way we could get a non-corrupt screen was
</I>&gt;<i> to use nopack but that made for lousy performance especially when
</I>&gt;<i> scrolling a graphics intensive page such as www.wsj.com or www.cnn.com.
</I>
YUK!!!

&gt;<i> Interestingly, even after upgrading, the client details screen says we
</I>&gt;<i> are running NXPROXY - version 3.4.0.
</I>
Ok... it maybe that the new x2goclient 3.99.0.0 for Win32 still uses  
old NX code on the client side. PyHoca-GUI still comes with nx 3.4.x.

BTW: the diff between the last libxcomp3 (3.4.x) and libxcomp3 (3.5.x)  
is very small!!!

&gt;<i> I don't know what in the Pyhoca installation caused this but completely
</I>&gt;<i> removing Pyhoca and previous x2goclient installations from both file
</I>&gt;<i> system and registry and installing 3.99 has not fixed the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks - John
</I>
I have tested PyHoca-GUI and x2goclient on Win2008r2 64bit right now  
(via rdesktop). Both actually fail, the nxproxy/x2goagent is most of  
the time not even opened, sometimes it pops up, but then it is gone.

Grml...

Mike
