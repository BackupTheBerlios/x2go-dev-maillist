Hello all,

last days I spent some time to test the latest version of x2goclient
(3.99.0) on different platforms:

Server

debian lenny i386, x2goserver-3.0.99-5, nxlibs-3.4.x, x2goagent-3.4.x
debian squeeze i386, x2goserver-3.0.99-5, nxlibs-3.4.x, x2goagent-3.4.x
debian squeeze i386, x2goserver-3.99.0.0, nxlibs-3.5.x, x2goagent-3.4.x
debian squeeze i386, x2goserver-3.99.0.0, nxlibs-3.5.x, x2goagent-3.5.x
debian squeeze amd64, x2goserver-3.0.99-5, nxlibs-3.4.x, x2goagent-3.4.x
debian squeeze amd64, x2goserver-3.99.0.0, nxlibs-3.5.x, x2goagent-3.4.x
debian squeeze amd64, x2goserver-3.99.0.0, nxlibs-3.5.x, x2goagent-3.5.x

Client

debian lenny i386
debian squeeze i386
debian squeeze amd64
windows7-32
windows7-64

I've tested connections in LAN and over Internet and was able to connect
and work without any serious issues.

During tests I've found some bugs:

- x2goclient crashing some times if user login unsuccessful (f.e. wrong
password)

- x2goclient crashing by unexpected output in user console (f.e. there
is a line in ~/.basrc &quot;cowsay hello&quot; or user shell set to /bin/false )

- under Windows system tray icon does not disappear on client close.

I'll fix this bugs ASAP.

Unfortunately, I can not reproduce some bugs reported of users on this
mailing list -
Issues with image packaging,
Issues with scrolling in firefox
Issues with delays after pressing Up/Down arrow keys.
Issues with failed connection on Win7-64

I can imagine, that some of this bugs are system dependent. X2Go uses
many components - x2go server, client, nxlibs, nx(x2go)agent. Under
windows x2goclient starts although X-server, SSH server and Pulseaudio
server. All this components are depended from many system libraries, for
example libpng, libjpeg, etc.

Unfortunately, we can not to test X2Go with all possible combinations of
software installed on user computer. We running our tests on fresh
installed OS with default set of software. And default options of
x2goclient (on Windows with default X-server and default command line
options)

If you expecting troubles running X2Go, please try, if it possible, to
install a &quot;clean&quot; OS, without any additional software (f.e. third-part
firewalls or antivirals on Windows) If X2Go running on such &quot;clean&quot;
system, you can compare it with you productive system and find out which
software blocking functionality of X2Go. As example, one of our
customers found out, that x2go client on Win7 can not connect to server
if Avast antivirus is installed.


regards,
alex
