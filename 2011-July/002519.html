<PRE>Is there some way to enable debugging or very detailed logging with
the Windows x2go client? With all the different problems people are
seeing, it seems the only chance at solving them is to have detailed
logs.

I am having a very strange problem with x2goclient 3.99 and 64-bit
Windows 7, but I am having a hard time reproducing it.

The problem is bizarre. When running firefox (4 or 5), if I have one
tab open with gmail, and another tab, then sometimes the firefox menus
and toolbar almost completely freeze up and firefox stops responding
(technically, it seems to be responding once every minute or so, one
click at a time). At first I thought this was a firefox bug, but then
I found that after firefox started freezing, sometimes it would freeze
up the rest of my applications (gnome-terminal, thunderbird, etc.) and
then release them again in a minute. Also, it NEVER happens with
x2goclient 3.01-13. I can install 3.99, start a session, have the
problem, then suspend the session, install 3.01-13, resume the
session, and the problem is gone. But if I resume the session again in
3.99, sometimes the freezes happen again. And sometimes not. I haven't
figured out a repeatable way to get the freezes, but they do seem to
require a firefox tab with gmail open.

</PRE>
