<PRE>Hello list,

after an update to the current set of packages there are some
points that should be (at least in my opinion) discussed.


1) Session Administration

At the moment, I can't see a user-friendly replacement of x2go-
sessionadministration. This tool is crucial for network usage
of x2go since your local administrator needs to be able to reset
sessions, connect to an users session and all that stuff.

Would the old code compiled against the qt3-libs in Debian Squeeze 
lead to a working solution?

Is there another tool that I wasn't able to find? x2godesktop-
sharing is of course not useable if the user session did freeze.

Was is the recommended way of stopping an users session (please 
read topic two before answering, it's not that easy)?


2) Database handling

How is the database cleanup of the sqlite3 database 

  /var/lib/x2go/x2go_sessions 

supposed to work? From my point of view this database is constantly
growing. I can't see that old sessions are cleaned up.

If a user connects to a LXDE of Debian Squeeze and performs a logout
via the menu, his session is still listed inside the database. So
this database is constantly growing what is definitely not what one
wants.

Another problem with this are hanging or crashed sessions. The database
gets very quickly inconsistent with the real system state. The user
sees a lot of session that are marked active at login but the processes
belonging to these sessions do not exist anymore. I found manually
cleaning up the database worked but this isn't comfortable at all
(i.e. not possible to do for everyone).

x2gocleansession is running but doesn't seem to be able to clean up
the database (permissions are correct, new sessions are inserted).


3) Smartcard usage 

This might be a separate topic which leads to a bug, but somehow the
timing between x2go und the scdaemon messed up. If a user does a 
session suspend via smartcard and puts his card in again after the 
card is available he gets an &quot;invalid card&quot; error message. If one
is a bit more patient and waits for 5-6 seconds it works again.

Did someone else experience this?

I can live with this at the moment.


How do others handle these problems in big networks? 

At the moment I'm really struggling to get to the point where x2go 
was in terms of usability at &quot;qt3-times&quot; (I know they are gone). 

Kind regards,
Martin &#214;hler
