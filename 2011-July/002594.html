<PRE>Hi, Alex. Thanks again for taking this seriously. I'll respond in the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi, Alex.  Although the packing and multi-session problems have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mysteriously vaporized as I reported elsewhere, I can confirm that we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; still have the following:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) Full screen toggles do not work in Windows - no magic pixel,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; AltCtl-M, AltCtl-F.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) AltTab does not work as expected in Full Screen mode - in fact,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rather than scroll through the X2Go desktop applications, it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; currently the only way to break out of full screen!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1 and 2 are xvcsrv issues. As I can remember, It was your idea to start
</I>&gt;<i> X in full screen mode by full screen X2Go session. The magic pixel and
</I>&gt;<i> AltCtl-M, AltCtl-F are possible to use only with window manager (on
</I>&gt;<i> windows only if vcxsrv started in rootless mode). The only way to do
</I>&gt;<i> this with vcxsrv in full screen mode is find a WID of vcxsrv and send
</I>&gt;<i> WS_MINIMIZE to it main window. To make it possible we should modify both
</I>&gt;<i> - x2goagent and x2goclient. My opinion - it is wrong idea. Vcxsrv should
</I>&gt;<i> be started in rootless mode even for full screen X2Go sessions. If it is
</I>&gt;<i> not working correctly, we should communicate with developers of vcxsrv
</I>&gt;<i> to solve this issue.
</I>
That makes sense except, if I remember correctly, there is a difference
between full screen and rootless.  If I choose fullscreen, it truly is
full screen and the user perceives only one desktop.  It is as if their
X2Go desktop is their only desktop and they do not have the problem of
frequently closing their desktop accidentally when closing a maximized
application, i.e., clicking on the wrong &quot;x&quot; in the top corner.  This
setting is highly desirable for those who work only or primarily in
their X2Go desktops (the majority of our clients).

In rootless, the X2Go desktop is still placed within a Windows but it
takes the entire available area aside from the window decorations.  This
is highly desirable for those who frequently toggle between their
physical and x2go desktops.

I would think we would want to accommodate both (and more!) styles of
work.  When in full screen mode, my desire would be that the keystrokes
would work as if the x2go desktop was the only desktop, i.e., Alt Tab
cycles through the x2go desktop apps.

&gt;<i> The same is with alt+tab. This events should catch vcxsrv. You can
</I>&gt;<i> specify by x2goclient the X-server you want to use and the command line
</I>&gt;<i> arguments to starting it. As far as you find a best combination of
</I>&gt;<i> vcxsrv version and command line arguments I'll make it default.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) I get a knotify: no process found error when exiting the Windows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; session.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> old workaround for kde3, I'll take care about it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) Evolution selection (as a representative graphics issue) is still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; painfully slow
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Still can not reproduce it. But even if I can, it is a nxlib problem and
</I>&gt;<i> will be not easy to solve. All output of nxlibs you can find on client
</I>&gt;<i> and server side in ~/.x2go folder. Have you this problem only with
</I>&gt;<i> recent versions of nx or was it always present? If it is a new problem,
</I>&gt;<i> please find a last version of nxlibs without this problem, it can help
</I>&gt;<i> to find a bug by researching of changelogs and diffs.
</I>

I'll have a look and try to dig deeper. It is a Windows only problem (or
perhaps I should say Windows exacerbated).

As I mentioned earlier, I do have a concern that a number of these
issues may not be specifically X2Go but rather vcxsrv or NX.  The vcxsrv
dev has been fabulously supportive.  I don't know about NX or if we have
the capability to fix it ourselves.  Thanks again - John
