</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This issue has two categories.  It is complicated by the packing problem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because we can only run the Windows client now with sub-optimal packing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but it was a problem before the corruption issue struck.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Screen painting is just slower - not just a little slower - a lot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; slower.  The typical anecdotal test I've been using is scrolling through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my Evolution Inbox.  Evolution has always seemed to have terrible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; graphics handling. I don't know what it does but it is always sluggish
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and awkward - thus an excellent test of how well we handle challenging
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; graphics.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Even under Linux on a LAN, scrolling is miserably slow.  Shift down
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arrow and wait 1/4 second for a response.  This is really annoying.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, in Windows, it is wait 1/2 to 3/4 seconds for a response.  This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; takes it from annoying to dangerous as users wind up deleting or opening
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unintended emails, i.e., the hold the shift down arrow until they think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they have highlighted the mails they want and then press enter.  What
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they don't realize is that five more emails will be selected because of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the delay between what they see and the key buffer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Ugh! Make that 2 to 3 seconds between down arrow and response!!!!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I tried to resume a session I had suspended from Linux but it complained
</I>&gt;<i> about a mismatched color depth.  I checked my Windows laptop and,
</I>&gt;<i> indeed, it was set to 16 bit color.  I changed it to 32 bit color and
</I>&gt;<i> performance has gone through the floor - John
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&lt;snip&gt;
Hmm . . . more important information. It almost looks like the events
are being buffered.  For example, if I arrow and wait, arrow, wait,
arrow, wait, arrow wait - each arrow takes about 2-3 seconds for a
screen response.  If I arrow, arrow, arrow, arrow, the first screen
response takes 2-3 seconds, then, 2-3 seconds later, all the other arrow
events are processed.

Are we disabling the Nagle algorithm on all the sockets we open? We
should if we are not.  Otherwise, we can see this kind of buffering
effect.  I don't know why that would cause such a change between 16 and
32 bit.  Just a thought - John
