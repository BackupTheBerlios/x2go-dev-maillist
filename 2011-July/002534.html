&gt;<i> I suppose I'll cover this one next as John Williams raised one of the
</I>&gt;<i> issues.  This is another Windows only issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This issue has two categories.  It is complicated by the packing problem
</I>&gt;<i> because we can only run the Windows client now with sub-optimal packing
</I>&gt;<i> but it was a problem before the corruption issue struck.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Screen painting is just slower - not just a little slower - a lot
</I>&gt;<i> slower.  The typical anecdotal test I've been using is scrolling through
</I>&gt;<i> my Evolution Inbox.  Evolution has always seemed to have terrible
</I>&gt;<i> graphics handling. I don't know what it does but it is always sluggish
</I>&gt;<i> and awkward - thus an excellent test of how well we handle challenging
</I>&gt;<i> graphics.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Even under Linux on a LAN, scrolling is miserably slow.  Shift down
</I>&gt;<i> arrow and wait 1/4 second for a response.  This is really annoying.
</I>&gt;<i> However, in Windows, it is wait 1/2 to 3/4 seconds for a response.  This
</I>&gt;<i> takes it from annoying to dangerous as users wind up deleting or opening
</I>&gt;<i> unintended emails, i.e., the hold the shift down arrow until they think
</I>&gt;<i> they have highlighted the mails they want and then press enter.  What
</I>&gt;<i> they don't realize is that five more emails will be selected because of
</I>&gt;<i> the delay between what they see and the key buffer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The other problem is a show stopper but I'm not sure it is an X2Go
</I>&gt;<i> issue.  I think this is the same issue John Williams is seeing.  We see
</I>&gt;<i> it only in Windows and Iceweasel.  It appears that Iceweasel hangs for
</I>&gt;<i> quite a long time - not just a few seconds.  My guess is 30 seconds to a
</I>&gt;<i> minute or more.  The system is really not hung.  All other applications
</I>&gt;<i> work fine and the screen paints normally.  It is just the Iceweasel
</I>&gt;<i> screen which does not paint.  Then, all at once, all the keystrokes and
</I>&gt;<i> clicks are suddenly executed.  It's as if the events are being buffered
</I>&gt;<i> or stored and not sent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Although we cannot rule it out, we think we have only seen this in a
</I>&gt;<i> single scenario - when using the Zimbra web client chat feature.  All
</I>&gt;<i> other browsing and multi-tab activity seems to be fine but, as soon as
</I>&gt;<i> someone sends me a chat message, Iceweasel painting stops . . . some of
</I>&gt;<i> the time.  Other times it works perfectly fine.  Once, it gave me a
</I>&gt;<i> white screen of death. Another time, it completely killed vcxsrv.  Most
</I>&gt;<i> of the time, it causes this event execution delay.  I can merrily go and
</I>&gt;<i> use other applications and all events are processed with no noticeable
</I>&gt;<i> delay; I just can use Iceweasel. Then, everything catches up, all the
</I>&gt;<i> events are processed, and all is well with the world once again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Zimbra is a heavy AJAX application.  I don't know if the application
</I>&gt;<i> John Williams is using is also heavily AJAX driven - John
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _&lt;snip&gt;
</I>I can confirm that the browser problem ONLY happens when using X2Go.  I
was able to run for quite a long time in Windows only chatting away on
the Zimbra web client chat service.  Not a single problem or delay. It
is nearly unusable under X2Go - John
