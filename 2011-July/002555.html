<PRE>Hello.

I mainly use x2goclient-cli to start/resume x2go sessions, for these reasons:

- No sessions have to be created in the GUI, all necessary options are
available as command line parameters. I can use aliases for all my
sessions and they work on any machine that has x2goclient-cli
installed, no further configuration necessary.
- Easier to start multiple x2go sessions than with the QT client.
- Automatically resumes existing session or starts a new one if needed.

If I've interpreted recent mail traffic (and roadmap in wiki)
correctly, x2goclient-cli is deprecated and will no longer be actively
develeoped. As far as I can see there currently are two alternatives
to using x2goclient-cli:

- x2goclient (the QT client) with command line options.
- pyhoca-cli.

x2goclient works quite well from the command line (with --hide), but
unfortunately you can't create a session only with command line
options, it needs a manually  (GUI) created session to be able to
connect. If you use x2goclient on multiple machines with multiple
sessions, it takes a lot of work to set them all up. If you want to
change or add anything, all clients will have to be manually updated.

pyhoca-cli supports needed command line options, but can't
automatically resume an existing session, you have to manually list
existing sessions and manually tell which session you want to
reconnect to. Also, closing the window terminates the session,
x2goclient and -cli suspend the session, you have to press Ctrl-C to
suspend a pyhoca-cli session which is cumbersome if you've put it in
the background.

Are there any plans to add command line functionality to x2goclient to
make it possible to connect/resume sessions without having to define
them in the GUI? As far as I can see, the option --user would need to
accept non-LDAP usernames and the options --server and --ssh-key would
have to be added.

Alternatively, can pyhoca-cli be updated with:

- An option to automatically resume an existing session if there is
one or create a new one if there isn't.
- An option to suspend a running session if the windows is closed, not
terminate it. Makes it possible to start pyhoca-cli in the background.

Cheers,
Daniel
