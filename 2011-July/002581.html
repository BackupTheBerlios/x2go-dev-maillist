I can confirm this is still a very serious problem.  I was still in
Windows when someone started chatting with me on Zimbra on my X2Go
desktop.  It literally took me 16 -2 20 second before I could respond to
them after every single time they typed something even if the chat
window was hidden.  Needless to say, it made it excruciating to conduct
that conversation.  It then dawned on me to connect to Zimbra directly
via the Internet bypassing X2Go.  I was able to carry on the same
conversation with no problem whatsoever - John
