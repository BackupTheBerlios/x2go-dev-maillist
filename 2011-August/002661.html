I was able to gain some interesting, confounding, and possibly important
data on this problem today.  I still haven't hooked up xkbwatch but I
did try a number of different combinations of clients and servers with
astoundingly different results.

The above results posted by John Williams, my results on a XP platform,
and Phil's results with 3.0.18 in Linux all have the 16-20 second delay
when speaking to either 3.0.1-5 or 3.99.0.0 servers with both X2GoAgents
3.4 and 3.5.

However, I tried two new combinations today:
 
3.0.1-4 Windows client to 3.0.1-5 server: frequent delay but 3 - 4
seconds - much, much shorter.  This explains why our clients are upset
but not throwing us out the door as they are all using this combination.

3.0.1-4 Windows client to 3.99.0.0 server with X2GoAgent 3.5: No delay
whatsoever - and that's after pounding it for a long time.

I know nothing about NX internals so I am just speculating here.  The
problem only seems to be with heavy AJAX applications as far as I can
tell.  Could it be related to how AJAX only paints part of the screen?
Could it be that NX does not pick up the screen change because if is
only a subportion of the application Window and done in a way different
from, for example, OpenOffice updates the area being typed? Could it be
that every certain number of seconds, NX checks the entire screen for
updates and that this timer is different in the various configurations
and maybe non existent with two mismatched Agents?

I have no idea but I would consider this a blocking bug.  I'll try to
squeeze some xkbwatch in this week - John
