<PRE>Hi Stefan,

I would prefer the solution suggested by Morty. Actually, I already
thought about it and i want include it in new implementation of
x2goclient. X2goclient will simply check a spool directory on server and
download a print jobs in PDF format via existing libssh connection. This
solution is much simpler, no need a cups, lpr, or ssh daemon running on
a client and implementation is just the same for all operating systems.
I can also implement this solution in current version of x2goclient if
somebody will sponsor the development.

regards
Alex

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, actually the best thing to do is probably letting the client &quot;ls&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> every sec (it's prabably not worth the trouble to inotify) and then scp
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to temp. But it needs someone to code that. After all, a x2go started as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a proof of concept rather then a product.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Uh, no.  You see, currently, I'm not using X2Go to connect via the
</I>&gt;<i> internet, it's all happening in my local network(s), so I don't have to
</I>&gt;<i> worry about encryption and compression for print data.  In this
</I>&gt;<i> scenario, I'm simply letting the CUPS servers talk to each other
</I>&gt;<i> directly, which works fine when the client is using Linux (or Mac OS, I
</I>&gt;<i> guess - after all, the Apple guys kinda bought CUPS).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For Windows, I'm using the LPR Daemon that is an optional windows
</I>&gt;<i> component, so to the server-side CUPS the Windows computer looks like a
</I>&gt;<i> network printer.  For printers that aren't supported by CUPS (the
</I>&gt;<i> el-cheapo GDI-only ones) I'm using a combination of redmon (a printer
</I>&gt;<i> port redirection tool usually used with ghostscript for Windows to
</I>&gt;<i> create PDFs) and a free PDF viewer: CUPS sends the print job in PDF
</I>&gt;<i> format via port 515/lpr, redmon accepts it, passes it to the PDF viewer,
</I>&gt;<i> which in turn uses the windows printer driver to create the print
</I>&gt;<i> output. If properly set up, all this happens in the background, with no
</I>&gt;<i> user interaction required and no windows popping up.
</I>&gt;<i> A bit of a hack for Windows, I admit, but it works just fine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, it would be nice if that would work over the internet, too, by
</I>&gt;<i> simply forwarding the proper ports through the already existing ssh
</I>&gt;<i> tunnel created by X2Go.  That way the print data would be encrypted and
</I>&gt;<i> compressed as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's why I don't see an advantage in mounting a remote filesystem via
</I>&gt;<i> SSH (which is a Pandora's Box of its own) simply to be able to print.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And even if you don't want to use LPR and redmon on Windows, there'd
</I>&gt;<i> still be the option of setting up a netcat listener on the client that
</I>&gt;<i> only accepts connections from localhost (the tunneled port connecting to
</I>&gt;<i> it), have that one write its data to a file, and print upon completion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Something as simple as (pseudocode, not actual bash/batch)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> printfile=$(makesafetempfilename)
</I>&gt;<i> # note that we're using port 9100 - &quot;raw&quot; network printer mode
</I>&gt;<i> # rather than 515 with its LPR protocol overhead, so we don't
</I>&gt;<i> # need to have the windows LPD and redmon installed
</I>&gt;<i> while nc -l -s 127.0.0.1 -p 9100 -w 1 &gt;printfile; do
</I>&gt;<i>    process_and_print printfile # this is where you call the PDF tool
</I>&gt;<i>    delete printfile
</I>&gt;<i>    printfile=$(makesafetempfilename)
</I>&gt;<i> done
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> would probably do the trick. Note that Windows netcat (at least the copy
</I>&gt;<i> I found) doesn't support &quot;-q&quot;, so you have to improvise with &quot;-w&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The way netcat is called it terminates upon completely receiving the
</I>&gt;<i> file, and the following tasks are not started before netcat terminates,
</I>&gt;<i> so there is no need to check for completeness of the file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, should a user fire off another print job before the while loop
</I>&gt;<i> returns to its head and restarts netcat, CUPS will simply assume the
</I>&gt;<i> printer is busy/offline and retry after a few seconds, so no print job
</I>&gt;<i> is lost.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure that even integrating such code (with a listener and the option
</I>&gt;<i> to pass a temporary file to a PDF tool) *directly* into the X2Go client,
</I>&gt;<i> rather than having it as an add-on component, would be a simple task for
</I>&gt;<i> a skilled programmer.
</I>&gt;<i>
