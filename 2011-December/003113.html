<PRE>Hello Stefan,

Alex an I have discussed your feature request. Due to the huge amount of
features implemented in the past, x2goclient has grown big and this way
we are planning a rewrite of the client.
This means that the accepted patch would only live until this new
release and the whole work is lost.
The new client is planned to be capable to show remote sessions embedded
inside the client window.

Please be aware that you can control x2goclient perfectly by command
line options. So this means it is possible to cover own ideas by using
the x2goclients hidden mode and key authentication.

I really understand that x2go can bee seen as nx replacement, but this
is not the projects &quot;main focus&quot;.

If you have questions about how x2goclient can be controlled by command
line options, please try x2goclient --help.

Though we don't think we will accept such a patch at the moment, we've
recognized your idea as a feature request and will discuss it again by time.

Regards,

Heinz
