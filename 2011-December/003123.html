Well, don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to hurry you here.  It's just 
that if you come to the conclusion that it will be, say, at least six 
months until this new client is released, I might even decide that the 
feature is important enough for me to pay for its addition twice - once 
in the current client and once in the upcoming one.  Or maybe I'll stick 
with the current client (plus my paid-for patch) for a while, assuming 
it will still be compatible with the $NEXT_INCARNATION_AFTER_BAIKAL server.

So, is there a *minimum* time frame after the Baikal release where you 
can more or less guarantee that a new client will *not* be released, and 
old clients will continue to function with new server releases?

Kind regards,
Stefan
