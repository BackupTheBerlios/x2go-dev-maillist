<PRE>I had used Remmina extensively before I found out about x2go.   Its a very
nice application.

The Remmina developers are now implementing the new freerdp 1.0 release
into Remmina which
will let Windows 2008r2 server applications that are configured for
RemoteAPPs to be run individually
in an x-window on your linux desktop just like any other linux app, resize,
minimize/maximize, print local,
save local etc.

Hi,

I said in my previous email that I would post the link when the &quot;lightning
talks&quot; video from UDS would be available. It's been uploaded this
week:<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnh7f36xkRA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnh7f36xkRA</A>

FreeRDP is first to go, we demoed RemoteApp and RemoteFX.

Best regards,
- Marc-Andr&#233;

x2go clients should implement the new freerdp.   It is going to be
replacing rdesktop in the 12.04 ubuntu release
from what I've heard.

Anyway... I had suggested to the Remmina devs a month ago that they ought
to look at supporting x2go
in their application since they already support rdp, nomachine nx, vnc etc.

Remmina has a very nice user interface.. it just doesn't have x2go .. yet?
