I had never heard of that before, but from the screenshots and download 
page, it's only available for Linux. I need a client that works on 
Windows and Mac OS X, too.  Plus, I'd prefer to stay as close to the 
plain, native X2Go server/client-system as possible.  Using an &quot;alien&quot; 
client means that whenever you run into functional issues (say, after a 
server upgrade, or a seemingly unrelated library upgrade on the client), 
the developers of the native system are less likely to be willing and 
able to help you than if it affects their native client.
