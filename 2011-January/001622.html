</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have two new Ideas.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. We providing a &quot;netinstaller&quot;. With defaults option it will get
</I>&gt;<i> x2goclient and Xming from net. There is &quot;advanced&gt;&gt;&quot; button in installer
</I>&gt;<i> dialog, which opening for user advanced options. Advanced options are:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;get vcxsrv instead of xming&quot; and &quot;not download Xserver&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. We providing 3 nsis-installers: x2goclient+xming, x2goclient+vcxsrv,
</I>&gt;<i> x2goclient without Xserver. The first installer is default and it is
</I>&gt;<i> easy to found on download page. The two other installers are hidden
</I>&gt;<i> under link &quot;other downloads&quot; or &quot;experimental&quot; or &quot;name is not
</I>&gt;<i> important, you understand what I mean&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would prefer second choice, because for large installations (I think
</I>&gt;<i> John have such one) is easier to provide a direct url to installer or
</I>&gt;<i> installer itself then by every installation configure installer to get
</I>&gt;<i> vcxsrv. There are less chances, that user make something wrong if he
</I>&gt;<i> just clicks with his mouse without understanding what he making. And is
</I>&gt;<i> easier to us (we don't need to create &quot;net installer&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>

Hi, Alex.  Thanks for being so open to input.  I also prefer option #2.
I'll certainly defer to whatever you choose but I'm really not certain
we need three installers.  By doing so, users must still make the same
decision (well, the downloading users which I suppose are more likely to
be admins than regular users in large deployments, that is true); we've
just shifted it from the installer to the download page.

I would think a single installer with sensible defaults, with vcxsrv
labeled as experimental, and with a big warning that says, &quot;Do not
change the defaults unless you know what you are doing,&quot; would be fine
and simpler to maintain.  Whatever we do, it does seem like we are
moving forward! Thanks - John
