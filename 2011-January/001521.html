Hello,

I have setup the x2go thin client environment. However, I'm having a few issues:

1. Sometimes the netboot process stops at the terminal login prompt and doesn't boot all the way into the x2goclient. How is the auto-login happening when it DOES work? Why would it be stopping sometimes at the login prompt and other times booting straight into the desktop client? Is the process run by a particular user?

2. When it is booting up into the fullscreen x2go client, anytime I try to make a session, it doesn't save the changes I make, thus I obviously can't login to a particular server. I put a video of the problem at
<A HREF="http://10addyrd.com/x2gotc.mov">http://10addyrd.com/x2gotc.mov</A>

3. Is there a way to prepopulate a session for users? Where is the .x2goclient/sessions file stored that is used by x2goclient in a thin client setup?

Thanks,
Neil
