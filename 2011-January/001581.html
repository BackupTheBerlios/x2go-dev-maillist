</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with x2goclient.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When I use a SSH key I get messages like this:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I guess this has to do with the usage of NFS.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ~/.x2go/ssh is 750 and root is squashed to nobody:nogroup. Thus it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; neither the user nor the group. Since
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chmod 777 ~/.x2go/ssh
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fixes key based login for me, it seems that something of x2go server is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using root privileges to access files in the home directory of the user.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Could this be changed to use user rights - root can su to any ? This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would work with NFS.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Other questions:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) Can X2go client be told to use an existing ssh agent which has the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; right identidy added? A ssh <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/x2go-dev">user at intraws</A> works already without asking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the key password, thus if x2goclient uses this ssh-agent it wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need to ask for the passphrase as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) What steps are necessary to integrate x2go with an *existing* LDAP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server? x2goldaptools depends on slapd and samba and since we use NFS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with an existing LDAP server I want neither of those. LDAP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; authentification via PAM works already. I can login with SSH and LDAP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; password of a user. I thought this would be enough for x2go *when* users
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that use x2go are in the group x2gousers. They are. But in the local
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; group. What additinional steps are necessary?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Hi, Martin. I suspect your problems may be more NFS related.  We are
</I>&gt;<i> using a separate LDAP server (Centos Directory Server) and have not
</I>&gt;<i> integrated with the X2Go LDAP tools.  All works fine with X2Go.  We do
</I>&gt;<i> use local x2gousers, fuse, and the various pulse groups and simply add
</I>&gt;<i> the LDAP defined users to them.
</I>
When I use SSH key based authentification with that setup, X2go works as 
expected when I do that chmod 777 on ~/.x2go/ssh before. Thus it seems to me 
that X2go principally works in that setup.

I only get the &quot;can't start ssh tunnel&quot; message when using password based 
authentification. But since that works as well via SSH, you are probably right: 
Maybe with password based authentification X2go tries to create some other file 
in the home directory in a directory that is still to restricted.

But rather than knocking around at random I'd like to know whats going on. 
Maybe I'll try to look up what X2go does exactly more closely to get an idea, 
I just asked here in case somebody knows more already.
 
&gt;<i> Just for kicks, have you tried it with a local home directory rather
</I>&gt;<i> than NFS? We use iSCSI for ours so all the file system semantics and
</I>&gt;<i> security are as if our storage was local.  Good luck - John
</I>
We decided for NFS for a reason. Everywhere else we use NFS or Samba and I do 
not want to introduce a island solution to our infrastructure.

BTW with LDAP integration I didn't yet mean automatic client configuration and 
such although something like that would be nice. As a first step I just like 
user authentification via passwords work at all. But until then we can also 
used SSH key based authentification.

Thanks,
