<PRE>Hello list,

I've made some tests on Windows XP and Windows 7 to see if Xming can be
replaced with VcXsrv.

The reasons to do this are:
1. VcXsrv is based on actual Xorg (7) git sources.
2. VcXsrv is licensed under GPL
3. Xming seems to have some bugs and based on old Xorg (6) sources.
Newer Xming versions are based on Xorg (7) but the license is not open.

The good news about our tests are:
1. VcXsrv in window mode (fixed size window with decorations) is working.
2. VcXsrv in rootless mode (fixed size window without decorations) is
working too.
3. VcXsrv in fullscreen mode is also working.
This was only a short test so nothing can be said about the stability of
VcXsrv yet.

The not so good news:
1. VcXsrv crashes in multi-window mode during the start of x2goagent (it
seems to work by resuming of x2goagent or in single-application mode).
2. VcXsrv is crashing or working incorrectly by reparrenting of
x2goagent window (embedding in other window) in multi-window mode.
3. VcXsrv is working incorrectly when the user wants to resize a window
in multi-window mode on Windows XP.


Conclusion:
1 - If we replace Xming by VcXsrv on Windows, it won't be possible to
resize the x2gosession window using mouse. You can set window geometry
in settings of x2goclient - these will be set for the whole connection
time. If you want to change this geometry, you' need to reconnect to
your session.
2 - We can not use VcXsrv for the x2goplugin at the moment, embedding in
browser will not work.

Because of this two reasons we can't completely replace Xming with
VcXsrv at the moment. I think, the issue named above must be fixed in
code of VcXsrv. At least next two month I'll have no time to do this. If
anybody is able to work on such a patch - please feel invited! Maybe it
is also a good idea to contact the developers and ask if they have ideas
how complex such a patch needs to be (John?).

What we can do now:
- Wait until this issues will be fixed
or
- We can provide x2goclient installer with VcXsrv (no resizing of DE and
buggy resizing of single applications on windows xp), but x2goplugin
with Xming
or
- We can provide x2goclient with Xming, but make it configurable to
launch other Xserver.
Please give us your opinion!


Regards,
Alex
