Hi, Martin. I suspect your problems may be more NFS related.  We are
using a separate LDAP server (Centos Directory Server) and have not
integrated with the X2Go LDAP tools.  All works fine with X2Go.  We do
use local x2gousers, fuse, and the various pulse groups and simply add
the LDAP defined users to them.

Just for kicks, have you tried it with a local home directory rather
than NFS? We use iSCSI for ours so all the file system semantics and
security are as if our storage was local.  Good luck - John
