Excellent idea.  If the VcXsrv devs could see their Xserver in action
w/x2go it might give them some insight into how to improve their Xserver.

</I>
We'd like to see the VcXsrv option for the plugin as well.


&gt;<i> Regarding the options, Phil and I have put some thought into the user

+1


&gt;<i> The X2Go Client interface, as opposed to the installer, should have
</I>&gt;<i> QRadioButton options to use Xming, vcxsrv, or other with a QLineEdit for
</I>&gt;<i> options.  The Xming and vcxsrv buttons can be disabled or hidden based

</I>&gt;<i> but rather use the settings from the session parameters.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I think it might be preferable to use disabling (grey-out) as opposed to
hiding things. 
I never liked apps that mysteriously made things appear and disappear.

Allowing use of existing installed Xserver is good idea.  Like Xming
(commercial).



Regards,
Gerry
