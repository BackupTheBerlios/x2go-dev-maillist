</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks, Oleksandr.  This is helpful.  Phil and I (mostly Phil) do have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vcxsrv up and running with libssh and on everything from Windows XP to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Windows 7.  It has eliminated all the crippling bugs and appears to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; perform better.  We can probably send you the simple code changes we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; made if it will save you some time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, we still have some of our original issues.  I'll restate them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using your numbers from above.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) Thankfully, vcxsrv is working perfectly fine in full screen and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rootless as well as multi-windows so these possibilities are now open to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; us.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) That's an important point but it still leaves us with the original
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dilemma: if we start X before we know the session parameters, we cannot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; run fullscreen or rootless.  More accurately, we can but we must choose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one of the three (fullscreen, rootless, or multi-window) before we know
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the session parameters.  If we default to full screen, then we get a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; full screen but the session may only paint into a part of it and leave
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the rest of the screen black.  My understanding from Phil is that it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does not automatically resize the session to consume the entire windows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like it does on Linux.  Even if it did, fullscreen is not what all users
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will want (or rootless or multi-window - exactly why we should give them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a choice).  My guess would be the delayed start would be a worthwhile
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trade-off for giving users important options.  Thoughts? Vehement
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; disagreements? Insults? (well . . . hopefully no insults :)  )
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) Argh!! That's really unfortunate.  Our practical experience is that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; losing &lt;ALT&gt;&lt;TAB&gt; significantly impacts productivity and makes the users
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more likely to resist transitioning to X2Go desktops.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) I think I did not communicate this well in my original email.  I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not referring to the &quot;magic pixel&quot; to minimize the X2Go session.  What
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we find happening VERY frequently is that a user has an application
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maximized in their X2Go desktop.  They then want to close the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application and do so by clicking on the top right most &quot;x&quot; box on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; title bar, i.e., the shortcut to close (alongside restore and minimize).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; They click the top right most one because that's the habit they have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; built for closing maximized applications and briefly forget that the top
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rightmost &quot;x&quot; is not the one for the application but the one for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; X2Go session.  Thus, they accidentally close their X2Go session rather
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than the application.  If they were working in full screen mode, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; X2Go desktop would be more like their physical desktop rather than a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; desktop within a desktop and thus their habitual actions are less like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be a problem.  It also gives &lt;ALT&gt;&lt;TAB&gt; and eliminates the confusion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we frequently hear among end users as they say &quot;now where am I - my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; virtual world or my physical world&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks again - John

</I>&gt;<i> Hello John,
</I>&gt;<i> All I wrote is relative to Xming, not vcxsrv. Sure, we will change a
</I>&gt;<i> behavior of X2Go client to make it work as good as possible with new
</I>&gt;<i> Xserver. For example, we can start Xserver after the users choose his
</I>&gt;<i> session, in this case x2goclient can use a time, that user need to type
</I>&gt;<i> password to start Xserver. It is possible, that vcxsrv have not alt+tab
</I>&gt;<i> problem in fullscreen mode. But I must do some researches before we will
</I>&gt;<i> replace Xming with vcxsrv. I hope, I can give you an answer next week.
</I>&lt;snip&gt;
Thanks, Oleksandr.  We just wanted to make sure we weren't overlooking
something before we set about changing the start sequence.  We'll get
working on our proposed changes to incorporate vcxsrv right away - John
