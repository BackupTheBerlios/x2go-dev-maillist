Dear Heinz, Alex, Mike and Moritz,
Dear List,

the actual  message I want to leave here is short -
but I think I have to give some explanations first so that my message  
doesn`t irritate anyone here (probably a rather female way of saying  
something, we like to explain things lengthy ;-)).

The professional background of writing this mail is, that mike and I  
are working together at a project in which we are setting up  
(educational) IT-Systems at schools in Kiel.
We want to use X2Go for this project and thats why I started reading  
this list a couple of weeks ago; its also the reason why I am very  
interested in having X2Go work well.
I have no technical IT-backgound, my contribution to and role in our  
project is to set up and implement a well-performing structure for all  
the communication that is needed (leading seminars, coaching,  
mediation, moderation of meetings etc.).

The private background is that I am in relationship with mike - that  
was first, the working together started only a few months ago.

One reason why I really enjoy working in an IT-context using Open  
Source Software is because I am deeply moved and inspired by the  
social, political and collaborative context in which every step of  
development is taking place.

Thats my context in which I am reading this mailing-list.

Now I have just read Mikes last mail and the only thing I want to  
contribute is:

YOU GUYS MUST TALK!

The guys I mean with that are Moritz, Alex, Heinz and Mike.
As far as I can see the four of you are all giving your best to do a  
very good job - but you might generate heavy misunderstandings and  
lots of extra work if your communication at this point of the  
developing process is taking place &quot;only&quot; via mail and programming.

There are very cheap telephone numbers which you can use for  
conference calls, I could give some of that numbers to Mike.
I think it would not take much time to have a conversation on the  
phone, but it could take a lot of time if you dont talk alltogether  
about the next steps necessary to take.

I am convinced that it would take a lot of stress out of the process,  
that it would move forward the whole project and that it would bring  
the freedom back into the space of the mailing list.

And, very important: NOTHING IS WRONG - its all development ;-).

Angela

</I>&gt;<i> as I understand your current way of handling things you are actually
