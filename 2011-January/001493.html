<PRE>Hi,

After installing the x2goserver-one debian package (and dependencies) from
x2go.obviously-nice.de on a completely fresh minimal debian Lenny install, I
could not get a session to start. After looking in &lt;home dir&gt;/.x2go/&lt;session
name&gt;/session.log I found the reason:

/usr/lib/x2go/x2goagent: error while loading shared libraries:
libXcomposite.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

After installing the libxcomposite1 package everything worked fine. So I
guess there is a dependency missing in the x2goagent package.

Secondly, I had a problem with the x2gocleansessions script that is run as
part of the x2goserver service. It tries to use sudo to execute x2gopgwrapper.
However, the sudo program uses the postinst script to set up the
default /etc/sudoers file while x2goserver tries to add to the sudoers file
in the preinst script. The result is that if sudo is installed as a
dependency of x2goserver, the sudoers file _only_ contains the x2go lines,
and not the default lines allowing root to do everything through sudo. Hence,
root is not allowed to issue the x2gopgwrapper command through sudo. This can
probably be repaired by moving the additions to the sudoers file into the
postinst script, as this will get executed _after_ sudo is completely set up
(sudo will make the default file in postinst as well). Also, you may want to
add a separate line allowing root to execute x2gopgwrapper anyway, such that
even if root is not allowed to do everything through sudo because the
sysadmin for some reason didn't want it, x2go will still function as normal.

Regards,
Gertjan
